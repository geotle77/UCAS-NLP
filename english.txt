(Xinhua/Du Xiaoyi)CHENGDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- As of December 2023, China had recorded more than 1 billion online audiovisual users, with some 98.3 percent of its netizens using audiovisual services, according to a research report released on Wednesday.The annual report on China's internet audiovisual service development was released in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, during the 11th China Internet Audio & Video Convention.The report shows that in 2023 alone, the size of China's market for the online audiovisual industry, including short video, livestreaming, audio and other fields, exceeded 1 trillion yuan (about 141 billion U.S. dollars) for the first time, reaching a total of over 1.15 trillion yuan.By December 2023, China had some 1.55 billion short-video accounts online, with more than 15 million professional livestreamers, according to the report.Over the past two years, the newly added audiovisual users in China have been mainly from its rural areas. In 2022 and 2023, the country recorded 299 million and 320 million rural audiovisual users on the internet, respectively, both showing a higher year-on-year growth rate than that of the urban users in the same period, said Zhou Jie, deputy secretary-general of China Netcasting Services Association, during the conference.  ■  URUMQI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosten Lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is China's largest inland freshwater lake.

Over the past nearly 80 years, the Gaitans, among others, have grown their family business from a small workshop to one of the biggest coffee purchasing and production companies in El Paraiso Department.The daughter of Santos Alberto Gaitan shows coffee beans to customers at the Gaitan Coffee Shop in Danli, Honduras, March 23, 2024. (Xinhua/Li Mengxin)During the sixth CIIE in November last year, Honduran exhibitors signed cooperation agreements for thousands of tons of coffee with Chinese importers.Making its maiden presence at the trade fair, Honduran companies also brought other major agricultural products like tobacco and chocolate, and the country was one of the five guest countries of honor at the event.For Gaitan and other Honduran businessmen, China stands as a top export destination with a booming market and growing demand. "The Chinese market is huge and very attractive. It offers numerous opportunities for business and cooperation," he said.Also during his meeting with Castro last year, Xi said China is willing to start the negotiation process for a free trade agreement at an early date. So far, negotiations on the China-Honduras Free Trade Agreement (FTA) have made substantial progress since they began last July. Last week, China and Honduras held the fourth round of the FTA negotiations in Beijing, conducting comprehensive and in-depth consultations on fields such as trade in goods and services, and investment. A month earlier, the two countries signed an early harvest arrangement for the bilateral FTA.Noting the rounds of FTA negotiations "have been carried out satisfactorily," Honduras' Minister of Economic Development Fredis Cerrato said the FTA will promote production and exports of premium Honduran agricultural and marine goods, generate jobs and foreign exchange, and attract Chinese investment.Fredis Cerrato, Honduras' minister of economic development, receives an interview with Xinhua in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, March 20, 2024.

We need to continue to build an increasingly strong long-term relationship, so that we bet on a win-win situation and that both countries can bring benefits to their people," Cerrato said.Given the ongoing FTA negotiations, Gaitan regarded it imperative for entrepreneurs like him to "learn more about Chinese culture and consumers, and seize the infinite opportunities of economic and trade cooperation between our two countries.""FRIENDS, BROTHERS"The closer bond between the two peoples since the establishment of China-Honduras diplomatic relations has brought an influx of Honduran visitors to China.Honduran artist Hermes Estrada has grabbed a chance to realize his "biggest dream" -- to go to China and learn Chinese music, dance and art.As a Chinese culture enthusiast, Estrada has been invited to participate in the Shanghai Tourism Festival scheduled for September. During the city's annual tourism extravaganza, Estrada and his troupe are expected to wow local residents and global travelers with their exquisite performance of Latin music and dance.The 42-year-old artist had paid a visit to China in 2012. In his eyes, Honduras and China, one of the world's most picturesque countries, are "friends and brothers."He believes that there are striking resemblances between the Chinese civilization and the Mayan civilization of Honduras, not least in emphasizing respect for nature and advocating harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature. "I hope I can have more opportunities to visit China," he added.During talks with the Honduran leader, Xi called on the two sides to promote people-to-people exchanges and consolidate the popular support for the friendship of the two countries.Over the past year, from launching the first course on traditional Chinese painting in Honduras to carrying out a joint archaeological project at the Maya Site of Copan, China and Honduras have achieved remarkable results in cultural cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, bringing the two ancient civilizations even closer.Many of the business leaders and journalists, who were in the China-visiting delegation led by Castro, said the trip has transformed their perception of China.An aerial drone photo taken on March 26, 2024 shows a building illuminated to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Honduras, in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province. (Xinhua/Li Bo)TELLING CHINA'S STORIESFor veteran journalists like Juan Ortiz, China-related topics and stories worth reporting are simply "too many to write."After reporting in China for two months, Ortiz, head of the Information Department of Honduran weekly the People Power, marveled at the dynamics and achievements of the Chinese modernization drive, which he believes has brought fresh development opportunities to Latin America.He pointed out an urgent need to represent a real China and its development trajectory in news reporting. "The reality of China is completely different from those distorted reports by the West," Ortiz said. "If you want to understand China, you must go to China and see so many wonderful places!"Ortiz's perceptions were echoed by multiple media delegates, who have visited China since the establishment of China-Honduras ties and whose footprints spanned from eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang to southwestern Chongqing Municipality.Kimberly Espinoza, director of Honduras' national public television broadcaster Channel 8, was deeply impressed by China's people-centered development philosophy. "President Xi always harbors sincere feelings for the people and values their well-being."From his perspective, establishing bilateral relations is a historic choice for Honduras, and China will bring great impetus and experience to benefit Honduras' development. "The world will see a brand-new Honduras," he added.  Enditem(Xinhua reporters Meng Yifei, Li Zijian, Zhang Yuan, Kang Wenjun, Wu Hao and Li Mengxin in Mexico City also contributed to the report.)■     People enjoy leisure time in a bay in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024.

(Xinhua/Wang Shen)FROM BLUEPRINT TO REALITYNauru, with its beautiful tropical scenery and brilliant sunshine, is endearingly dubbed as a "pearl of the Pacific." In the southwestern part of the island nation, rows of blue photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged close to the azure sea, reflecting the dazzling tropical sunlight.Once connected to the grid, the photovoltaic power generation and energy storage project being constructed by a Chinese company can meet the electricity demand of the entire island.The project will reduce Nauru's dependence on diesel, bringing down the costs in electricity generation, improving local power supply and increase the share of renewable energy generation. Most importantly, it will significantly add to Nauru's environmental protection efforts, thereby achieving its sustainable development goals."Now Nauru's power generation mainly relies on diesel. That's expensive and would pollute the environment," said John Scott, who has been working for the project since 2022."There is a lot of sunshine here and it's good for solar power. I believe electricity supply here will be much better when the project is completed," Scott told Xinhua.On top of building the power project, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is also undertaking the redevelopment of Nauru's largest harbor, Aiwo Harbor.Starting in 2019, the project to be completed in 2025 includes harbor dredging and the construction of a new wharf, a desalination system and a container yard, among other facilities. And in September 2022, the new wharf was put into operation.The modern seaport has also brought cutting-edge technologies and job opportunities to the island country, facilitating local economic growth by expanding its connectivity with the rest of the world.Zhu Wei, the contractor's deputy manager and construction manager of the project, has witnessed the development of Aiwo Harbor over the past five years."In the past, the old wharf was too small for container ships to dock directly, and they only came once every two months. Now the containers can dock directly at the new wharf, and they come every month or even every 20 days," Zhu told Xinhua.As the facilities are gradually taking shape, Zhu is proud of his efforts over the past years. "I'm looking forward to seeing the projects I have personally participated in contribute more to the economic development of Nauru."The rationale behind Nauru's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China "of course is about Nauru's development strategy," Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's foreign minister, said when visiting China in January."No developing country wants to be left behind," he said.This photo taken on Jan. 20, 2024 shows a coastal view of the Republic of Nauru. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)"GRASS OF HAPPINESS"Being a Pacific island nation, Nauru is struggling to cope with such pressing challenges as rising sea levels and land erosion brought about by climate change. Worse still, the meager resources of fresh water for daily life is a persistent concern for local residents.Due to its unfavorable natural conditions for cultivation, Nauru heavily relies on imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits, resulting in high prices in the market, said Joanna Olsson, director of the Government Information Office of Nauru.Juncao, a hybrid grass developed by Chinese scientists as a major multi-functional agricultural resource, offers a feasible resolution to these woes. Translated literally as mushroom grass, Juncao can be used for mushroom farming, or as livestock forage and poultry feed, and a green barrier to forestall desertification.When working in east China's Fujian Province more than two decades ago, Xi Jinping introduced the Juncao technology to a visiting provincial governor from Papua New Guinea, another island nation in the Pacific, marking the beginning of international cooperation on Juncao technology.Having taken root in over 100 countries and regions around the globe, Juncao has been hailed by the locals as the "Chinese grass" or "grass of happiness."Last month, Hess-Tekai Foilape, an agricultural extension officer for Nauru's Department of Environment, Management and Agriculture, became the first person from Nauru to attend a Juncao technology training course held by Chinese scientists in Fiji."I believe that adopting Juncao technology in Nauru would be highly beneficial for our country. Potential impacts include improved food security, increased resilience to climate change, and enhanced economic opportunities through the development of new industries," Foilape told Xinhua.People use fishing nets to catch seafood in the sea in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)GROWING TOGETHERBoth developing countries, China and Nauru face the common tasks of growing the economy, improving people's wellbeing and realizing modernization.China has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its own deeds, Foreign Minister Aingimea said.Recalling his visit to a waste-to-energy plant and an electric vehicle factory in China, he said what impressed him most was "how advanced it is.""The technology blew my mind, absolutely amazing," he said, depicting China's path towards modernization as "fast and visionary."The Belt and Road Initiative brings development opportunities to Pacific island nations, said Olsson, who is optimistic about future cooperation between the two nations, particularly on climate change, water supply and agriculture.In his meeting with Adeang, Xi said China is ready to provide assistance to Nauru for its independent and sustainable development without political strings attached.Friendship, old or new, will have a bright future as long as it is started. Cooperation, whatever its size, will be productive as long as it is sincere, Xi said.■     Once a humble fishing village in China's tropical island province of Hainan, Boao now welcomes visitors from both nearby and afar.

The presidents of the two states held talks on Monday and reached important consensus, which signifies the beginning of a new chapter in China-Nauru relations.He said China is ready to work with Nauru to deepen mutual trust and expand mutually-beneficial cooperation.The premier added that China will firmly support Nauru in safeguarding its independence and national dignity, and choosing a development path in accordance with its own national conditions. China is willing to strengthen mutual support with Nauru on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns.Li said China will encourage Chinese companies to invest in Nauru and is ready to further enhance bilateral cooperation in fields including infrastructure construction, transportation, tourism and health under the framework of joint construction of the Belt and Road. He called on the two countries to expand exchanges between localities and youth.Li also said China and Nauru will jointly promote full and effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, and strengthen mutual support and coordination within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations and Pacific Islands Forum to jointly safeguard the common interest of developing countries.Adeang said Nauru will adhere to the one-China principle and support China's peaceful reunification. Nauru highly appreciates China's adherence to the principles of mutual respect and equality, and its commitment to promoting international peace and cooperation.Nauru is ready to enhance cooperation with China in areas including trade, infrastructure construction, climate change, sustainable development, health, tourism, education and people-to-people engagement, as well as coordination under multilateral mechanisms, he said.Adeang is on a state visit to China from March 24 to 29 at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

(Xinhua/Li Bo)BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign firms continue to view China as a favored investment destination, driven by the country's steadfast commitment to opening up and innovation, according to representatives of multinationals at the "Invest In China" Summit 2024 held in Beijing on Tuesday.The summit, jointly hosted by the Ministry of Commerce and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, marks the first signature event of "Invest in China," a government campaign to attract foreign investment and help foreign companies better understand China's opportunities.Attendees of the summit noted that China's robust economic resilience, fueled by its enormous market potential, burgeoning emerging industries, and high-quality talent pool, instills enduring confidence among foreign companies to continue investing in the country."China is now an innovation leader and a nation of engineers, alongside its status as a manufacturing powerhouse and a key consumer market," said Tetsuro Homma, executive vice president of Panasonic Corporation, at the summit.Homma emphasized that the country also serves as a "testing ground" for foreign enterprises, given that products thriving in the Chinese market often gain a competitive edge in other markets as well.To delve deeper into the Chinese market, the Japan-based multinational corporation has unveiled a series of investment plans and established 18 investment bases in China in the past four years. The latest endeavor in expanding its footprint in China involves announcing the construction of a world-class production base for new integrated circuit materials in Suzhou, a city in east China's Jiangsu Province, on March 21.As a firm proponent of opening up, China has intensified its efforts to expand access to its markets by streamlining rules, regulations, management practices and standards. These initiatives have reassured foreign investors, according to the participants at the summit.To further attract foreign investors, China has pledged to fully lift restrictions on foreign investment access in its manufacturing sector this year.Earlier this month, the country issued an action plan to further attract and utilize foreign investment, proposing 24 measures across five aspects, such as expanding market access, facilitating the flow of innovation factors, as well as better aligning domestic rules with high-standard international economic and trade rules.According to Mats Harborn, president of Scania China Group, the action plan demonstrates the government's determination to remain an integral part of the global economy, which bodes well for foreign investors engaging in long-term business in China."By providing clarity on many of China's new laws, the perceived investment risk for foreign investors will decrease," Harborn said, adding that this will allow the company to prioritize value creation over risk management.A leading truck maker in the world, Scania has made heavy investments in China, building its third global production hub in the country after Europe and Latin America. According to Harborn, the company's move to establish supply chains worldwide, particularly in China, has strengthened the company's resilience against disruptions caused by natural disasters or geopolitical tensions.Drawn by the improved business environment and vast market potential, more foreign companies are opting to establish their presence in China despite the rising tide of global protectionism. Data from the Ministry of Commerce showed that some 7,160 new foreign-invested firms were set up across China during the first two months of this year, up 34.9 percent year on year, the biggest surge in nearly five years.Foreign business leaders at the summit also pointed out the huge opportunities arising from China's pursuit of innovation-driven and green development.Christof Ehrhart, executive vice president of Robert Bosch GmbH, highlighted China's determination to sustainable development, noting that it has created greater opportunities for the company to develop relevant technologies in China.According to Ehrhart, China, partly propelled by its decarbonization goal, has emerged as a leading market in hydrogen technology, particularly in commercial vehicle applications. "There's even more opportunities for us to develop such technologies that might be part of the solution here in China, for China, but also beyond.""We believe in the future of the Chinese market. We're going to stay here for Chinese customers, and for Chinese companies to be successful on global markets," Ehrhart added.  ■  This undated photo shows the Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. (Ethiopian Space Science and Geospatial Institute/Handout via Xinhua)Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.Ethiopia, as one of the growing list of countries cooperating with China under the BRI, has witnessed the initiative's significant contribution in terms of meaningfully transforming the lives of millions of Ethiopians, said Melaku Mulualem, a senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Foreign Affairs."The BRI has improved the lives of many Ethiopians. Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations. Through this global initiative, many Ethiopians have got job opportunities," he said.Photo taken on Feb. 29, 2024 shows the sorting machine at the e-commerce logistics hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)Citing a well-known Chinese saying that goes "If you want to get rich, you must first build roads," Mulualem said completed large-scale Chinese-built infrastructure projects are currently advancing Ethiopia's domestic and regional integration. He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI. He said the success of these projects vividly illustrates the multifaceted benefits of jointly building high-quality BRI projects.Recent data from the Ethiopian government also support his assertion. Since the Chinese-built Ethiopia-Djibouti railway's official commercial operation in January 2018, the railway had operated 1,824 passenger trains with nearly 530,900 passengers, and 6,133 cargo trains with about 7,328,500 tonnes of cargo as of June 2023.The railway, often regarded as Africa's first modern cross-border electrified railway, also witnessed its total operating revenue maintaining an average annual growth rate of more than 35 percent.The cooperation with China under the BRI is also propelling Africa's second-most populous country's aspiration of becoming a manufacturing hub and a lower-middle income economy shortly through the large-scale development of industrial parks across the country. Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people.

(Xinhua/Xiao Yijiu)WUHAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Based on skeleton remains and burial objects, archaeologists have reconstructed the face of a local official back in the Qin Dynasty (221 BC-207 BC).The official is believed to have diligently recorded documents on over 1,100 bamboo slips that formed one of China's earliest encyclopedias.The official, aged 45 to 50 upon his death, was owner of bamboo slips with over 40,000-characters preserved in his tomb.The documents serve to provide valuable insight into the legal and administrative system, medical manuals and a rich chronicle of some events, according to the researchers.The ancient official now has his face reconstructed thanks to modern technologies including 3D scanning of his skull. The public is expected to see the restored official and learn about the living conditions of his time in the museum within this year.The bone remains and bamboo slips were all first unearthed in 1975 at a tomb site in Shuihudi, Yunmeng County of Hubei Province. Researchers from the Hubei provincial museum, the provincial cultural relics and archaeology institute teamed up with Jilin University to carry out the facial restoration work in 2019. ■     The horn comb is one of the "Three Treasures of Fuzhou," a city in east China's Fujian Province. Find out how these exquisite hair combs are made in this video■  BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A series of released data regarding southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region highlights the all-round progress of the plateau region.

Julian Assange faces a further wait to find out whether he can bring an appeal against his extradition to the United States, the High Court ruled on Tuesday. (Xinhua/Li Ying)LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Wikileaks founder Julian Assange faces a further wait to find out whether he can bring an appeal against his extradition to the United States, the High Court ruled on Tuesday.According to the ruling, a decision on the appeal has been adjourned to May 20 as the court is seeking assurances from the United States that Assange could rely on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and he would not be sentenced to death if convicted."If those assurances are not given, then leave to appeal will be given and there will then be an appeal hearing," a summary of the judgment said.Speaking outside the High Court in London, Assange's wife Stella Assange said she is "astounded" by the court's decision to delay her husband's appeal."What the courts have done has been to invite a political intervention from the United States," she said. "I find this astounding."Assange is "a political prisoner," she told supporters. "He is a journalist and he is being persecuted because he exposed the true cost of war in human lives."His case is "a signal to all of you that if you expose the interests that are driving war they will come after you," Stella said as she urged the U.S. government not to submit assurances to the High Court and to drop "this shameful case.""This is a shame on every democracy," she added.Dave Putson, a protester outside the High Court holding a banner that reads "Free Julian Assange," said the court's ruling is "a wrong decision.""I think he should have been freed five years ago. I don't think he should be incarcerated at all," Putson told Xinhua.Putson described the court's decision as an attack on freedom of the press. "He was exposing war crimes. He wasn't committing war crimes when he was releasing the WikiLeaks information, and he shouldn't be incarcerated for doing journalism."The protests will continue, he said, "until we can actually get the result that we want and Julian Assange deserves, and press freedom deserves."Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the British National Union of Journalists, said the risks to Assange and press freedom "remain stark," despite the delay to the High Court's ruling."Assange's prosecution by the United States is for activities that are daily work for investigative journalists -- finding sources with evidence of criminality and helping them to get their stories out into the world," she said. "If Assange is prosecuted, free expression the world over will be damaged."Assange, 52, is wanted by the United States on allegations of disclosing national defense information following WikiLeaks's publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked military documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars a decade ago, which included an Apache helicopter video footage documenting the U.S. military gunning down Reuters journalists and children in Baghdad's streets in 2007.He has been held at southeast London's high-security Belmarsh Prison since 2019. Britain approved his extradition to the United States in 2022 under then Home Secretary Priti Patel after a judge initially blocked it on Assange's mental health concerns. Assange and his lawyers have appealed since then. ■Signs showing support for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange are seen in a protest outside the High Court in London, Britain, on March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Hu Yousong)BALTIMORE, the United States, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Maryland officials said on Tuesday that two people have been rescued while six others are still unaccounted for following the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld told reporters at a news conference that eight people were on the bridge when it was struck by a cargo ship in the Patapsco River in the early hours of Tuesday.One of the two individuals saved from water is in the hospital and the other is fine. Rescue teams continue to search for missing people in the water."The preliminary investigation points to an accident," Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. "We haven't seen any credible evidence of a terrorist attack."The crew on the ship notified authorities they had lost power and issued a "mayday" call before it collided with the 2.6-kilometer-long, four-lane bridge, according to Moore.The White House said on Tuesday that U.S. President Joe Biden "has been briefed on the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the ongoing search and rescue efforts," adding that he "will continue to receive updates from his team throughout the day."Biden will address the incident later on Tuesday, according to reports.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that they "are closely monitoring the tragic situation unfolding.""There are no indications this was an intentional act and we are assessing the impacts to the Port of Baltimore," Mayorkas added.The U.S. Coast Guard said that it received a report saying a Singapore-flagged container vessel collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge at 1:27 a.m. (0527 GMT) on Tuesday, and that it is coordinating with local, state, and federal agencies in response to the incident.Kweisi Mfume, who represents Maryland's 7th congressional district that encompasses parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, wrote on X that "the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse is an unthinkable horror.""Our prayers right now are for the missing individuals and victims of this tragedy," Mfume said.Danish shipping giant Maersk said in a statement on Tuesday that the container ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge is "DALI", which is owned by Grace Ocean, and operated by Synergy Group."It is time chartered by Maersk and is carrying Maersk customers' cargo," the statement read. "No Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel.""Due to the damage to the bridge and resulting debris, it will not be possible to reach the Helen Delich Bentley port of Baltimore for the time being. In line with this, we are omitting Baltimore on all our services for the foreseeable future, until it is deemed safe for passage through this area," Maersk said.Synergy Group, based in Singapore, confirmed the safety of all crew members and pilots without any reported injuries or pollution. The cause of the incident remains under investigation.The Francis Scott Key Bridge, which opened to traffic in March 1977, carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. ■Photo taken on March 26, 2024 shows the collapsed bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States.

(Photo by Mustafa Kaya/Xinhua)by Burak AkinciANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- "In Ramadan, our meals have now become meatless," said Firuze Tanil, a Turkish pensioner who visited a butcher shop in Ankara to buy some ground meat for her grandchild.The prices of red and white meat have soared in Türkiye amid runaway inflation, despite the government's efforts to mitigate its impact on consumers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan."Many people are getting poorer and cannot afford meat for fast-breaking meals," Tanil said at a shop in the Balgat neighborhood of Türkiye's capital city, Ankara.In Tanil's household, her 5-year-old grandson is the only regular consumer of meat amid economic strains, said Tanil, an accountant before her retirement."Our purchasing power has dropped dramatically for every food item over the past year due to rampant inflation," Tanil added.Official data released in early March revealed that the annual food inflation rate soared to 71 percent this month, higher than the year-on-year consumer price increases, which climbed to 67.1 percent.Statistics provided by workers' unions put the figures even higher. Research carried out in March by the United Public-Business Confederation revealed a staggering 112 percent increase in meat prices in a year, marking the most significant surge among all food products.According to official statistics published in late January, 39.2 percent of Türkiye's population could no longer afford a meal containing meat every other day.Analysts have attributed high meat prices to structural problems, including inadequate planning in agricultural and livestock farming, discrepancies between producer and retail prices, and restrictions on the import of animals.Fazli Yalcindag, the head of Ankara's Chamber of Butchers, attributed the price increase to the rising cost of feed and volatility in the foreign exchange market."Many farmers are culling their cattle because milk prices are low and meat prices are high. Therefore, cows are sent to the slaughterhouses, and the production cycle ends," he said, adding that many households have removed meat from their tables due to soaring prices."Meat prices seem to climb higher with each passing day," said Volkan Aktas, a teacher and father of three children who was shopping at Yalcindag's shop in Ankara."To address this issue, instead of eating out, we are strictly eating in our house. This is the way we cope with high prices," he said.In addition to consumers, the rising prices of meat have posed a significant challenge for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, particularly in the lead-up to the local elections scheduled for Sunday.Ahead of Ramadan, the Turkish leader ordered state authorities to crack down on profiteers and hoarders during Ramadan.Local media reported that people are lining up at state-run Meat and Milk Board stores during Ramadan to purchase affordable meat. The firm offers meat at nearly half the price of supermarkets and butcher shops.Moreover, special stores in the Ankara Metropolitan Municipality also offer meat at discounted prices during Ramadan.Ali Ekber Yildirim, a journalist and author specializing in the agricultural industry, said meat prices would likely increase at the inflation rate.In a video blog published last week, Yildirim predicted that supply and demand would remain imbalanced for at least two to three years. Thereby, meat prices will remain high during the same period. ■This photo taken on March 25, 2024 shows meat for sale at a butcher shop in Ankara, Türkiye.

(Xinhua/Wang Shen)During talks with the Nauruan president, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific island nation Nauru on Monday signed up for the Belt and Road Initiative in the presence of its president, David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China on March 24-29, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.It is Adeang's first China trip since the two countries restored diplomatic ties earlier this year.During talks with the Nauruan leader, Xi pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.As the two presidents are charting the course for further growth of bilateral ties, a Chinese-aided solar power project being built with the participation of nearly 100 Nauruan workers has already begun to make a difference to local communities, a living testament to the fast-growing win-win cooperation between the two countries.A man works at the construction site of redevelopment project of Aiwo Harbor in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)FROM BLUEPRINT TO REALITYNauru, with its beautiful tropical scenery and brilliant sunshine, is endearingly dubbed as a "pearl of the Pacific." In the southwestern part of the island nation, rows of blue photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged close to the azure sea, reflecting the dazzling tropical sunlight.Once connected to the grid, the photovoltaic power generation and energy storage project being constructed by a Chinese company can meet the electricity demand of the entire island.The project will reduce Nauru's dependence on diesel, bringing down the costs in electricity generation, improving local power supply and increase the share of renewable energy generation. Most importantly, it will significantly add to Nauru's environmental protection efforts, thereby achieving its sustainable development goals."Now Nauru's power generation mainly relies on diesel. That's expensive and would pollute the environment," said John Scott, who has been working for the project since 2022."There is a lot of sunshine here and it's good for solar power. I believe electricity supply here will be much better when the project is completed," Scott told Xinhua.On top of building the power project, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is also undertaking the redevelopment of Nauru's largest harbor, Aiwo Harbor.Starting in 2019, the project to be completed in 2025 includes harbor dredging and the construction of a new wharf, a desalination system and a container yard, among other facilities. And in September 2022, the new wharf was put into operation.The modern seaport has also brought cutting-edge technologies and job opportunities to the island country, facilitating local economic growth by expanding its connectivity with the rest of the world.Zhu Wei, the contractor's deputy manager and construction manager of the project, has witnessed the development of Aiwo Harbor over the past five years."In the past, the old wharf was too small for container ships to dock directly, and they only came once every two months. Now the containers can dock directly at the new wharf, and they come every month or even every 20 days," Zhu told Xinhua.As the facilities are gradually taking shape, Zhu is proud of his efforts over the past years. "I'm looking forward to seeing the projects I have personally participated in contribute more to the economic development of Nauru."The rationale behind Nauru's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China "of course is about Nauru's development strategy," Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's foreign minister, said when visiting China in January."No developing country wants to be left behind," he said.This photo taken on Jan. 20, 2024 shows a coastal view of the Republic of Nauru. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)"GRASS OF HAPPINESS"Being a Pacific island nation, Nauru is struggling to cope with such pressing challenges as rising sea levels and land erosion brought about by climate change. Worse still, the meager resources of fresh water for daily life is a persistent concern for local residents.Due to its unfavorable natural conditions for cultivation, Nauru heavily relies on imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits, resulting in high prices in the market, said Joanna Olsson, director of the Government Information Office of Nauru.Juncao, a hybrid grass developed by Chinese scientists as a major multi-functional agricultural resource, offers a feasible resolution to these woes. Translated literally as mushroom grass, Juncao can be used for mushroom farming, or as livestock forage and poultry feed, and a green barrier to forestall desertification.When working in east China's Fujian Province more than two decades ago, Xi Jinping introduced the Juncao technology to a visiting provincial governor from Papua New Guinea, another island nation in the Pacific, marking the beginning of international cooperation on Juncao technology.Having taken root in over 100 countries and regions around the globe, Juncao has been hailed by the locals as the "Chinese grass" or "grass of happiness."Last month, Hess-Tekai Foilape, an agricultural extension officer for Nauru's Department of Environment, Management and Agriculture, became the first person from Nauru to attend a Juncao technology training course held by Chinese scientists in Fiji."I believe that adopting Juncao technology in Nauru would be highly beneficial for our country. Potential impacts include improved food security, increased resilience to climate change, and enhanced economic opportunities through the development of new industries," Foilape told Xinhua.People use fishing nets to catch seafood in the sea in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)GROWING TOGETHERBoth developing countries, China and Nauru face the common tasks of growing the economy, improving people's wellbeing and realizing modernization.China has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its own deeds, Foreign Minister Aingimea said.Recalling his visit to a waste-to-energy plant and an electric vehicle factory in China, he said what impressed him most was "how advanced it is.""The technology blew my mind, absolutely amazing," he said, depicting China's path towards modernization as "fast and visionary."The Belt and Road Initiative brings development opportunities to Pacific island nations, said Olsson, who is optimistic about future cooperation between the two nations, particularly on climate change, water supply and agriculture.In his meeting with Adeang, Xi said China is ready to provide assistance to Nauru for its independent and sustainable development without political strings attached.Friendship, old or new, will have a bright future as long as it is started. Cooperation, whatever its size, will be productive as long as it is sincere, Xi said.■     This undated photo shows the Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia.

Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations.

He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI. He said the success of these projects vividly illustrates the multifaceted benefits of jointly building high-quality BRI projects.Recent data from the Ethiopian government also support his assertion. Since the Chinese-built Ethiopia-Djibouti railway's official commercial operation in January 2018, the railway had operated 1,824 passenger trains with nearly 530,900 passengers, and 6,133 cargo trains with about 7,328,500 tonnes of cargo as of June 2023.The railway, often regarded as Africa's first modern cross-border electrified railway, also witnessed its total operating revenue maintaining an average annual growth rate of more than 35 percent.The cooperation with China under the BRI is also propelling Africa's second-most populous country's aspiration of becoming a manufacturing hub and a lower-middle income economy shortly through the large-scale development of industrial parks across the country. Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people. Training and skill transfer are very important to make Ethiopians even more capable to handle and run completed projects. These will make the implementation of BRI projects much more sustainable," he said.  ■  Chinese Premier Li Qiang meets with Nauruan President David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 26, 2024.

I incorporate traditional Chinese medicine nursing skills into my daily work, and many elderly individuals here appreciate it," Chen said.Chen graduated from Liaoning Vocational College of Medicine in 2018. The institution is run by the provincial government to cultivate highly skilled professionals in nursing, pharmacy and medicine.In that same year, an educational cooperation agreement was signed between the vocational college and Germany's Oscar Kemmel Vocational College for a nursing talent training program. Subsequently, the first batch of 17 Chinese students pursued studies in Germany, with six opting to serve as elderly care workers in German nursing homes, including Chen.In recent years, China has actively expanded its vocational education to align with the demands of enterprises.

(Xinhua/Li Yahui)Statistics show that in the past decade since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative, more than 400 higher vocational colleges in China and foreign educational institutions have forged cooperation in running schools, with Luban Workshop established in over 20 countries.Many vocational education programs from China have also been introduced in the Belt and Road participating countries, cultivating high-quality professional employees.In 2017, the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, a Belt and Road flagship project jointly built by China Road and Bridge Corporation and the Kenya government, officially opened to traffic. Two vocational colleges from Liaoning sent their staff to Kenya and helped Kenya train over 300 railway talents."Recently, we've signed two new international joint education programs, mainly serving the construction of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and China-Mongolia railway. Compared with previous programs, we are paying more attention to the employment and technical needs of the enterprises this time," said Dong Yanan, vice president of Liaoning Railway Vocational and Technical College.At present, China has the world's largest vocational education system. According to data released by the Ministry of Education in 2023, there are 9,752 secondary vocational schools in the country, with over 17.8 million students. In 2022, there were 1,521 higher vocational schools with an enrollment of 5.46 million students. These institutions annually produce approximately 10 million high-quality technical personnel.OVERSEAS PROGRAMS"Many believe that only students with good academic performance from famous universities have the opportunity to study abroad. Now, we can also study abroad through our own efforts and excellent vocational skills, which is a great encouragement to me," said Chen Xingwang, one of the six students from the School of Economics and Management at Guangzhou Nanyang Polytechnic College who studied in the Republic of Korea last year.In order to better serve the development of Chinese enterprises overseas, 18 vocational colleges in south China's Guangdong Province have launched 39 overseas education programs.Students attend a vocational program run by BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

"We have a full agenda for FTA negotiations this year," he said.TOWARD A BROADER FTA NETWORKAs negotiations for Version 3.0 of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area are scheduled for this week in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Wang has vowed to exert efforts to conclude the talks this year.The building of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area was completed in 2010. According to customs data, trade between China and ASEAN since 2013 has logged an annual growth rate of 8.8 percent. In 2023, ASEAN was China's largest trading partner for the fourth straight year, while China held its position as ASEAN's largest partner for several years.Visitors shop at the pavilion for Vietnamese commodities at Nanning International Convention and Exhibition Center in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Sept. 18, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhou Hua)The two parties announced the official launch of the negotiations to upgrade the free trade area to its third version in November 2022, with the negotiations covering fields such as trade in goods, investment, digital and green economy to build a more inclusive, modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial China-ASEAN FTA.Experts believe that the upcoming version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area would also prompt the upgrade of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).It will be easier for the RCEP to leverage its coordinating and superimposing effects, following the leading example of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area Version 3.0, said Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University of China.Apart from ASEAN, China also aims to complete the FTA negotiations with Honduras, and the negotiations involving the FTA upgrade with Peru this year. Advancements will be made in negotiations or upgrades of FTAs with the Gulf Cooperation Council, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland, according to the vice minister.Peruvian craftsman Oswaldo Mamani promotes alpaca toys at a booth of Warmpaca at the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) in east China's Shanghai, Nov. 7, 2023. (Xinhua/Wang Xiang)On a broader scale, Wang Shouwen noted that China will continue its efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).In an attempt to align with the CPTPP rules, China has introduced related documents and formulated reform measures to enhance institutional opening-up in Shanghai and other eligible regions. "If the practices yield good outcomes, we will replicate them in other regions of China," Wang Shouwen said.TOWARD HIGH-STANDARD OPENNESSIn the past year, China committed to a negative-list model of services and investment opening-up by signing an FTA with Nicaragua and reaching a protocol to further upgrade the FTA with Singapore.This marked a historic moment in China's FTA negotiation history, indicating that the country has reached a new level in advancing its FTA network toward high standards, according to Wang Shouwen.Commenting on the FTA upgrade protocol with Singapore, Yuan Bo, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said services and investment are where the growth potentials of the two countries' future development reside. "These two fields are the common interests of China and Singapore."Regarding RCEP cooperation, Yuan believes there is ample room for China to collaborate with RCEP members on consumer goods trade, cross-border e-commerce, service trade and investment, among other spheres.China's foreign trade value with 14 RCEP members amounted to 12.6 trillion yuan (about 1.77 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023, a 5.3 percent increase compared with that in 2021 before the agreement came into force, according to Wang Shouwen.People visit the booth of South Korea during the 2023 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at China National Convention Center in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 4, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Chao)The pact has allowed Chinese trade companies to enjoy 2.36 billion yuan of tariff concessions for products imported from RCEP countries, while enterprises of RCEP countries benefited from 4.05 billion yuan of tax breaks for products imported from China in 2023."China is both a beneficiary of and a significant contributor to the enforcement of RCEP," Yuan said.Looking into this year, to further develop China's FTA network into a high-standard one, the country will continue to increase the proportion of zero-tariff products, push forward the comprehensive opening-up of service trade and investment with market-access negative lists, and include trade rules concerning digital economy, green economy, standard certification and government purchase into new FTA negotiations, Wang Shouwen said.  Enditem(Video reporters: Wu Changwei; Video editors: Zhang Yueyuan, Hui Peipei, Zheng Xin, Zhang Nan)■     NANNING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's coconut, famous for its rich and sweet taste, has gained significant popularity in the Chinese market. In recent years, it has been extensively used in various foods and beverages in China, such as cakes, coffee, and hot pot, especially after the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement.   The RCEP, which entered into force on Jan. 1, 2022, comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries, including 10 ASEAN member states and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand.   Two years on, many Thai industries in agriculture, textiles, and automobiles have benefited from the RCEP. Tariff cuts have further stimulated trade and investment growth of RCEP member countries. In 2022, Thailand's trade with other RCEP members rose 7.11 percent year on year to 300 billion U.S. dollars.   The agreement has also boosted trade cooperation between China and Thailand. According to Han Zhiqiang, Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, in the first 10 months of 2023, bilateral trade between the two countries reached 105.1 billion dollars. China continued to be Thailand's largest trading partner for 11th consecutive year and its largest agricultural export market, of which tropical fruits alone reached 5.8 billion dollars, accounting for 90 percent of Thailand's fruit exports.   Han said that Thai durian has transformed from a niche fruit to a "top stream" product in the Chinese market. Chinese consumers favor Thai fruits, and the Chinese government supports Thai agricultural exports to China.   "As a fruit importer, the RCEP agreement brings real benefits to me. The growing popularity of Thai coconuts in China is also bringing me new opportunities," said Mo Jiaming, a fruit dealer in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.   Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the RCEP, more diversified trade and transportation modes have been adopted, and more Thai goods have entered the Chinese market at favorable prices.   The transport of fresh Thai durians from Thailand to southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on the flagship BRI project, the China-Laos Railway, takes only four days. This is a vast improvement compared to the previous land-sea routes, which took eight to 10 days.   "Goods which could only be previously purchased during a trip to Thailand are now available in local supermarkets with a rich variety," said Huang Ying, a Nanning citizen, adding that she has many Thai products at home ranging from rice and seasonings, to latex pillows and mattresses, and daily beauty and sun protection products.   The RCEP agreement has also enhanced the industrial chains of China and Thailand, bringing new opportunities to enterprises.   Construction machinery made by Guangxi Mesda Group Co., Ltd. has entered the markets of ASEAN countries like Thailand in recent years, and has been warmly welcomed by local customers.   Huang Kanghua, chairman of the company, said that ASEAN countries have a great demand for China's advanced technology and products. "We are full of confidence in the ASEAN market," Huang said.   In the first nine months of 2023, Chinese enterprises applied for 264 investment projects in Thailand, up 196.6 percent year on year, with a total investment value of 97.46 billion baht (about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars), up 116.5 percent year on year. China will continue to maintain its position as the largest source country of foreign investment in Thailand.   Kirida Bhaopichitr, director for the Economic Intelligence Service of the Thailand Development Research Institute, said that Chinese investments drive the growth of industries such as electric vehicles in Thailand.  ■     Members of the press work near the site where a bridge collapsed in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States, on March 26, 2024.

Rescue teams continue to search for missing people in the water."The preliminary investigation points to an accident," Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. "We haven't seen any credible evidence of a terrorist attack."The crew on the ship notified authorities they had lost power and issued a "mayday" call before it collided with the 2.6-kilometer-long, four-lane bridge, according to Moore.The White House said on Tuesday that U.S. President Joe Biden "has been briefed on the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the ongoing search and rescue efforts," adding that he "will continue to receive updates from his team throughout the day."Biden will address the incident later on Tuesday, according to reports.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that they "are closely monitoring the tragic situation unfolding.""There are no indications this was an intentional act and we are assessing the impacts to the Port of Baltimore," Mayorkas added.The U.S. Coast Guard said that it received a report saying a Singapore-flagged container vessel collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge at 1:27 a.m. (0527 GMT) on Tuesday, and that it is coordinating with local, state, and federal agencies in response to the incident.Kweisi Mfume, who represents Maryland's 7th congressional district that encompasses parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, wrote on X that "the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse is an unthinkable horror.""Our prayers right now are for the missing individuals and victims of this tragedy," Mfume said.Danish shipping giant Maersk said in a statement on Tuesday that the container ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge is "DALI", which is owned by Grace Ocean, and operated by Synergy Group."It is time chartered by Maersk and is carrying Maersk customers' cargo," the statement read. "No Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel.""Due to the damage to the bridge and resulting debris, it will not be possible to reach the Helen Delich Bentley port of Baltimore for the time being. In line with this, we are omitting Baltimore on all our services for the foreseeable future, until it is deemed safe for passage through this area," Maersk said.Synergy Group, based in Singapore, confirmed the safety of all crew members and pilots without any reported injuries or pollution. The cause of the incident remains under investigation.The Francis Scott Key Bridge, which opened to traffic in March 1977, carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. ■Photo taken on March 26, 2024 shows the collapsed bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States.

The U.S. movie star was regretting not being born during the Chinese Year of the Dragon (龙 lóng), which in 1964 started in February, not January, according to the lunar calendar.In China, newborns in such years as 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, and, you guessed it, 2024, are dubbed "dragon babies."They are thought to be blessed with bravery and wisdom characteristic of the Chinese dragon, one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac cycle that also incorporates the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Yet the dragon stands out as the only mythical animal; it enjoys great popularity.Far from the fire-breathing monster in the West, the dragon in Chinese culture symbolizes good fortune and prosperity, and is supposed to bring ample precipitation indispensable to a good harvest.The legendary creature has been immensely popular throughout Chinese history. People of the Chinese nation identify themselves as "descendants of the dragon." And emperors boasted about being "true dragons from heaven" who proudly wore elaborately embroidered dragon robes.The dragon is important in Chinese culture. From tales passed down for generations to thousand-year-old bronze relics, from annual dragon boat races to dragon dances, this mythical creature holds a special place in the collective memory of the Chinese people.Among the many signs of its cultural prominence, "chengyu," or Chinese idioms usually consisting of four characters, are arguably the most representative. Take a look.Paint dragons and dot the pupils of their eyesLegend has it that an ancient Chinese painter was commissioned to paint dragons on a wall. The moment he finally dotted the pupils, the dragons came alive and flew to the sky. A well-known idiom in China, it refers to the finishing touch that brings a work of art to life. Interestingly, the practice of "dotting the pupils" is very much alive today. Prior to lion dances, distinguished guests will be invited to "awaken the lions by dotting their pupils," after which the animals are brought to life to entertain the audience with lively performances.Crouching tiger, hidden dragonA martial arts film directed by Ang Lee was named after it and earned ten Academy Award nominations in 2001. Pairing two powerful creatures, the tiger (虎 hǔ) and dragon, this idiom is usually used to refer to "hidden talents." To some extent, the expression alludes to the deep-seated unobtrusiveness of the Chinese people, who refrain from aggressive moves but keep honing skills to better themselves. The combination of tiger and dragon is not uncommon in chengyu, for example, 生龙活虎 (shēng lóng huó hǔ, doughty as a dragon and lively as a tiger, brimming with energy) and 龙腾虎跃 (lóng téng hǔ yuè, dragons rising and tigers leaping -- a scene of bustling activity).As high-spirited as a dragon-horseA mystical creature, the dragon-horse (龙马 lóng mǎ) is a positive sign in Chinese culture used to describe being lively, vibrant or animated. People often exchange greetings with this expression at the beginning of the Year of the Dragon and Year of the Horse.Parents wish their sons to "become dragons"What about the daughters? They are expected to become phoenixes (凤 fèng) as in 望女成凤 (wàng nǚ chéng fèng). It's not that Chinese parents are bent on turning their offspring into immortals, but they set great store by their children's future success. It is hoped that with a decent education and hard work, their children will succeed in life and thrive like dragons and phoenixes. In fact, the two imaginary creatures are grouped time and again as symbols of auspiciousness, e.g., 龙凤呈祥 (lóng fèng chéng xiáng): the dragon and phoenix bring prosperity and good fortune.   A local driver is pictured beside a train of the Lagos Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) Blue Line in Lagos, Nigeria, March 2, 2024.

The rail-sea intermodal service has expanded to cover 71 cities in 18 provincial-level regions in China.  ■        BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday that the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation will serve as an engine for the common development of all countries and an accelerator for the modernization of the whole world.   Wang told a press conference that since the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was put forward over 10 years ago, it has produced fruitful outcomes and become the most popular global public good and the largest platform for international cooperation. It has also become a pathway to cooperation, opportunity and prosperity for partner countries.   Wang said China will work with all parties to uphold the Silk Road spirit, deliver on the outcomes of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in 2023, and usher in a second golden decade of Belt and Road cooperation.   China will promote the upgrading of physical connectivity, the strengthening of institutional connectivity and the deepening of people-to-people connectivity, and the country wants to make the BRI a lasting opportunity shared by all, according to Wang.  ■     This aerial photo taken on Feb. 23, 2023 shows the Qinzhou Port in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. (Xinhua)NANNING, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of trips made by China's rail-sea intermodal trains on the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor saw robust growth in January this year, company sources have said.The rail-sea intermodal trains made 978 trips in January, up 87.7 percent year on year, according to the Beibu Gulf Port Group.Launched in 2017, the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor is a trade and logistics passage that was built by provincial-level regions in western China and ASEAN members.The trade corridor has developed rapidly over the years, covering 70 cities in 18 provincial-level regions in China and expanding its reach to 495 ports in 120 countries and regions.  ■     CHONGQING, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor reaches 490 ports in 120 countries and regions, according to the annual session of the people's congress of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on Sunday.   This trade corridor, jointly built by provincial-level regions in western China and ASEAN members, saw its cargo volume rise 21 percent year on year in 2023. Chongqing, which is the corridor's operational hub, became even more open to the world thanks to the corridor's greater impact last year.   China-Europe freight train services handled by Chongqing and the city of Chengdu, in the neighboring Sichuan Province, cover 110 cities in Europe and Asia. A total of 33 international flight routes involving Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport were resumed last year, said the city's mayor Hu Henghua when delivering the government work report.   Chongqing has continued to optimize its foreign investment and trade mix. In 2023, exports of the city's "new three" products, namely electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar cells, doubled compared with the previous year. The value of the city's automobile exports registered 51.9 percent year-on-year growth in 2023.   A total of 782 new foreign enterprises were established in Chongqing last year, while the city's import and export volume amounted to 713.74 billion yuan (about 100.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023.  ■        BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's economic and trade ties with countries along the Belt and Road have strengthened significantly over the past decade, an official said Friday.   "Despite the protracted COVID-19 pandemic and complicated international situation, the building of the Belt and Road Initiative continues to demonstrate strong resilience and vitality, injecting strong impetus into global openness and cooperation and world economic recovery," Sheng Qiuping, vice minister of commerce, told a press conference.   From 2013 to 2021, the annual trade volume between China and countries along the Belt and Road expanded from 1.04 trillion U.S. dollars to 1.8 trillion dollars, marking an increase of 73 percent, Sheng said.   During this period, China's direct investment in countries along the Belt and Road totaled 161.3 billion dollars, while 32,000 enterprises were established in China by these countries, with a combined investment of 71.2 billion dollars, Sheng added.   China signed new contracts worth about 1.08 trillion dollars with countries along the Belt and Road in the period for engineering projects in transportation, electricity and other areas, he said.   In the first four months of this year, China's imports and exports with countries along the Belt and Road jumped 15.4 percent year on year to 3.97 trillion yuan (about 588 billion dollars), 7.5 percentage points higher than the overall growth of China's foreign trade, said Wang Lingjun, deputy head of the General Administration of Customs.  ■        BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China will promote the green development of the Belt and Road, strengthening international cooperation on the issue, the country's top economic planner said Monday.   China aims to enhance cooperation in multiple areas with the countries along the Belt and Road by 2025 and form a green development pattern for the initiative by 2030, according to a guideline issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and three relevant departments.   Cooperation on clean energy will be deepened as China encourages solar and wind power companies to "go global," and promotes technological cooperation in areas including renewable energy, advanced nuclear power, smart grids and hydrogen energy, said the guideline.   Meanwhile, new-energy vehicles and smart transportation plans will be promoted along the Belt and Road, the development momentum of China-Europe freight trains will be consolidated, and green logistics will be advanced, it said.   China will continuously optimize the trade structure and vigorously develop trade in green products featuring high-quality, high-tech and high-added-value, it added.   Collaboration on coping with climate change and green finance will also be stepped up, the guideline said.  ■

HONG KONG, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- In early December, landlocked Laos took a quantum leap toward the nation's dream of becoming a land-linked hub thanks to the inauguration of the China-Laos Railway.
Laos is the only nation in Southeast Asia without direct access to the sea. Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith called the occasion "a proud moment and the dream of all ethnic groups of Laos."
The first electrified railway in Laos was made possible by the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China's grand plan for a better-connected world was also behind Vietnam's first metro line, which went into commercial operation in capital Hanoi in November.
The Asia-Pacific is home to an extending infrastructure network which was further energized over the past year by new bridges, dams, highways, power lines and railroads, among other BRI projects. Even the COVID-19 pandemic did not slow down work for long. The East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia had almost its entire staff fully vaccinated by October.
Around the world, 141 countries and 32 international organizations, including 19 UN agencies, have participated in the BRI.
CHINESE TECHNICAL STANDARDS
In Bangladesh, the awe-inspiring Padma Bridge nears completion. The rail-road bridge is expected to speed up development and poverty reduction in the southwest of the riverine country, and to complete a key link in the envisaged trans-Asian rail network.
The Padma Bridge has 40 piers sunk into the sandy riverbed. According to Bangladeshi project engineer Dewan Muhammad Abdul Kader, "Every pier and span presented numerous challenges" to the Chinese engineers.
The China-Laos Railway has 75 tunnels in the 422-km Laos section. There -- and in Belt and Road projects elsewhere -- advanced technology and techniques are making short work of geological complexities.
Chinese management and technical standards are extensively applied. VR systems providing a virtual workplace for safety training help protect Malaysian workers, while state-of-the-art equipment like China's tunneling machines boosts progress in building the railway in eastern Malaysia.
Phase-II of the Karakoram Highway was declared one of the best projects in the world this year by U.S. weekly Engineering News-Record in September. Part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the highway is just one of 46 corridor projects underway or completed. Pakistan sees the corridor as a gamechanger for its national development.
CLEAN AND GREEN
No more coal-fired power plants will be built as part of the BRI, and a large number of hydropower projects are completed, underway or in the pipeline.
Notably, the Sirindhorn Dam in northeastern Thailand combines a floating solar farm with an existing hydropower plant. The Thai government plans to reproduce this model in 15 other locations as part of its climate commitment to a green low-carbon growth.
All Belt and Road projects are constructed in an environment-friendly manner, with a strong imperative to protect the local ecosystem. Construction of the railway created some 110,000 jobs in Laos, but the route remains just as verdant and lush as before the earthmovers arrived.
"After construction, revegetation goes. This is not just high-quality engineering, but also common sense. We want to leave the trackside in the condition we found it," said chief engineer Huang Daiwen. Huang's team has even applied for a patent for "roadbed slope revegetation devices" developed during their work in Laos.
Building hydro dams, of course, takes into account habitat protection for terrestrial wildlife. In the water, dams on the Nam Ou River in Laos have been restocked with native species of fish. Over 2 million fry have been released into the river over past years. And that's not just good for the health of the biosphere, it's good for local people too. Fish restaurants have sprung up, attracting customers from Luang Prabang, dozens of kilometers away. Songkham Yathika, 55, likes boasting about his personal journey from mountain man to fisherman to restaurateur.
LIVELIHOODS AND RISING HOPES
Thanks to the resumed BRI arrangement of chartered freight, in November the flow of pine nuts from Afghanistan to China got moving again, much to the relief of rural people whose only income comes from the nut. The whole pine-nut industrial chain provides at least 40,000 jobs in Khost and Paktia provinces. This trade is a lifeline in Afghanistan amid what might otherwise be a harsh winter of food shortages, economic crises and COVID-19.
To Sri Lankans, the BRI will bring more things than clean water to 450,000 Katana residents and a new outpatient building in commercial capital Colombo.
In September, a children's picture book, A City Rising from the Ocean was published. It tells the story of Colombo Port City, a financial hub growing on land reclaimed from the sea for the past seven years. Port City marina staged Colombo Fashion Week shows in November. A PwC study in November said that, once fully operational, the port city project will add 13.8 billion U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka's economy.
The China-funded 60,000-seat Morodok Techo National Stadium, built in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, was handed over to Cambodia in September. The country is now ready to host the Southeast Asian Games in 2023.
BROADER CONNECTIVITY
"The stadium serves as another bridge to connect the hearts of the two peoples," said Cambodian government's chief spokesperson Phay Siphan.
In inaugurating the eighth Cambodia-China Friendship Bridge in November, Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen thanked the BRI for benefiting the Cambodian people and thanked China for COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Those supplies have been instrumental in achieving the country's very high vaccination rates, with 13.56 million people or 84.8 percent of the population being fully vaccinated as of Dec. 15.
Cambodia is also setting up a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine filling factory. It is among the 29 countries in Asia-Pacific that began Belt and Road partnerships on COVID-19 vaccines cooperation and green development this June.
To return to the biggest BRI event of the year, the China-Laos Railway connecting Kunming in Southwest China to Lao capital Vientiane is a docking project between the BRI and Laos' development strategy.
According to President Thongloun, the shining green line of high tech through primal forest symbolizes the spirit of a community of a shared future and the shared dreams of peoples.

(Xinhua/Ju Huanzong)BEIJING, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- China and five Central Asian countries launched an action plan on Wednesday to promote cooperation on green technology in ecology, agriculture, and biodiversity.The Action Plan for Green Technology Development in Central Asia was kicked off at a high-level forum on green development held simultaneously with the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF) in Beijing.The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, together with their partners from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, announced the cooperative program.They vowed to jointly address the region's massive challenges, such as climate change, ecological degradation, and environmental crises, using their considerable experience and know-how in ecological governance, efficient water-saving agriculture and food security, sustainable use of water resources, and biodiversity protection.The action plan includes building a dialogue mechanism among national research institutions, an innovative tech center to drive eco-friendly growth in the Aral Sea region, and multiple demonstration areas for water security, water-saving irrigation, and planting in saline-alkali soil.The collaborative priority will be given to the sustainable development of the water-food-energy ecosystem in Central Asia, the ecological restoration in the Aral Sea region, and the sustainable uses of water, biological, and land resources, according to the action plan."More efforts will be made in building joint labs and field stations and training talents for the Central Asian countries," said Zhang Yuanming, head of the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography under the CAS.  ■  A train is seen during a trial running of light rail transit (LRT) system, which was jointly built by Chinese and Egyptian companies, in east of Cairo, Egypt, July 3, 2022. (Xinhua/Sui Xiankai)by Xinhua writers Zhou Qianxian, Zheng Jingxia and Wang XiuqiongBEIJING, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- From manufacturers and lenders to consulting service providers, it's not uncommon to see multinational corporations participating in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. With global ambitions, many of them have embraced the tailwind produced by the BRI to expand their presence and navigate business landscapes across the world.With the trial run of Egypt's first electrified light rail line (LRT) last year, more than 180 escalators and elevators provided by American multinational Otis Worldwide Corporation for the project were put into operation.The LRT was one of the major BRI projects that saw participation from Otis in recent years. The multinational also supplied about 50 elevators and escalators for one of the tallest building in East Africa -- the new headquarters of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia inaugurated last year, among other projects."Over the years, Otis has been deeply involved in BRI projects," said Sally Loh, president of Otis China. The company has provided vertical transport solutions and dispatched technical teams to support elevator installation for many signature projects, she noted."By actively engaging in these projects, Otis has fully leveraged its advantages of being a global brand and manufacturing in China to support infrastructure construction and smart city development and contribute to regional prosperity," she said.As one of the world's major financial institutions, Deutsche Bank has borne witness to multinationals' participation in BRI projects."We see cases where multinationals co-develop renewable energy projects with Chinese players in the Middle East, and occasions where multinationals appear in the supply chain of BRI projects," said Peter Qiu, president of Deutsche Bank (China) Co., Ltd.Third-party market cooperation opportunities are appealing to multinational corporations, Qiu added.The German lender has been engaged in several BRI projects, including Sinosure's guaranteed syndication for China Harbor's infrastructure project in Jamaica and trade services for Chinese solar projects in Saudi Arabia.Having a global network of professional firms providing audit, tax and advisory services, KPMG has set up offices in more than 90 percent of BRI participating countries and regions, and will continue to scale up services for BRI-related investment and trade activities, said Jiang Liqin, head of clients and markets for KPMG China.Advancing the BRI will bring huge investment and development opportunities for local businesses cooperating with Chinese enterprises to improve their research, technology and application capabilities, Jiang added.Multinationals play an important role in facilitating infrastructure connectivity, smoothening trade and promoting financial integration under the BRI, which in turn provides huge business opportunities for them, said Liu Nanxing, an expert on international cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)."BRI cooperation has created enormous demand for products, investment and economic cooperation in various fields such as infrastructure construction," he noted. "It has offered multinationals new partnerships and supply orders, and increased needs for their services."Many multinational companies pay great attention to the BRI and make it one of the key factors to be considered in their global layout, in a bid to strengthen cooperation with various parties and broaden the space for development, he said.According to a white paper on BRI cooperation released by China's State Council Information Office, countries and businesses are encouraged to engage through various forms such as bilateral cooperation, third-party market cooperation and multilateral cooperation, thereby creating synergy for development.By joining third-party market cooperation, enterprises from different countries can work together to carry out projects, which can reduce the risk of undertaking projects on their own, especially given the large scale of some BRI projects, said Liu.The BRI is not only attractive to multinational giants, but also for foreign-funded small and medium-sized companies, which could enter overseas markets through the BRI to boost international development, Liu added.Since the BRI was proposed in 2013, over 3,000 cooperation projects have been launched, involving close to 1 trillion U.S. dollars of investment, creating an array of national landmarks, livelihood projects, and milestones of cooperation.The Chinese government has been clear that it is open to multinational companies taking part in BRI projects, and for those willing to engage, it offers some interesting opportunities since multinationals and Chinese firms have complementary contributions to make, said Carl F. Fey, Professor of Strategy at BI Norwegian Business School.He said multinationals can lend international experience to the projects as well as technology and strong brand names, while they can benefit from taking part in such projects by obtaining additional business, especially given the sluggish global economy.Multinationals are both a driving force and beneficiaries of globalization, which now faces challenges and calls for transformation, while BRI cooperation is a major contributor to the sound development of globalization, said Liu from the NDRC.Looking forward, he believes that the BRI, by connecting broad regions with economic vitality and potentials, will shape new growth centers for the world economy, help partner countries advance modernization, and propel global economic recovery."This process will generate even more opportunities for both partner countries and multinational companies," he said.  ■  This photo taken on July 31, 2023 shows the Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, Spain.The train service from the Chinese small commodity hub of Yiwu to the European commodity center of Madrid was officially launched in November 2014, spanning eight countries in Eurasia with a total length of more than 13,000 kilometers.The train service from Yiwu to Madrid has become a carrier of economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries along the railway and has built a new bridge for opening and cooperation between countries and peoples along the line.

Before arriving in Hamburg, it made stops at various ports, including Dalian, Shanghai, Ningbo, Singapore, Piraeus, and Rotterdam. Right now, it is heading back to Shanghai.The container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo calls at Meishan port area of Ningbo Zhoushan Port in east China's Zhejiang Province, Aug. 21, 2023. (Xinhua/Wei Yijun)In command of this colossal ship is Captain Mo Weidong, a seasoned mariner with over three decades of shipping experience. It is Mo's fifth year sailing on this specific route."Having sailed back and forth on the route between China and Europe, I have indeed witnessed the transformative effects of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)," the 54-year-old captain told Xinhua reporters, as the ship called at Ningbo Zhoushan Port.From the vantage point of the ship's bridge, perched dozens of meters above the deck, a bustling scene unfolds at the port. Containers are being impeccably stacked in precise rows by the gantry cranes used adeptly to handle them, ensuring an efficient and seamless workflow."Since the beginning of this year, we've seen a notable increase in cargo volumes on this shipping route," said Mo, while adding that there has been a surge in the exports of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.Captain Mo Weidong operates the radar at the bridge of the container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo on its way to Rotterdam Port, in the Mediterranean Sea, Sept. 15, 2023. (Xinhua)Mo also revealed that aircraft parts will now be shipped weekly from the Port of Hamburg to the Tianjin Port via this route, further attesting to the thriving trade and economic exchanges between China and Europe.At present, the Port of Hamburg is directly connected to major Chinese ports via 15 regularly scheduled liner services. Approximately one-third of the containers processed at the Port of Hamburg either originate from China or are bound for China.Jens Meier, CEO of Hamburg Port Authority, underscored the significance of cooperation between the Port of Hamburg and Chinese ports. "We are actively sharing knowledge and strengthening the corridors, particularly in maritime supply chains, as well as land-based corridors," Meier explained.A container ship of China's COSCO Shipping calls at the Port of Hamburg in Germany, Aug. 12, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)In late August, the COSCO Shengshi, a ship used to carry vehicles, arrived at Germany's Port of Bremerhaven, where it unloaded 530 commercial vehicles from China, marking the successful maiden voyage of the liner.On its way to Bremerhaven, a total of 3,731 Chinese-made commercial vehicles, including over 2,700 new energy vehicles, were loaded onto the ship at the ports of Shanghai and Xiamen.Following its departure from Xiamen, the COSCO Shengshi navigated across the Indian Ocean and passed through the Suez Canal, making stops at ports in the UK and Belgium before finally reaching Germany. This 43-day journey spanned approximately 9,900 nautical miles.Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few years, the flow of trade between China and Europe has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Mo observed an increase in trade volume, noting that it now takes two days to unload at Piraeus Port in Greece, compared to one and a half days previously.This aerial photo taken on Feb. 19, 2022 shows a terminal of Piraeus Port in Greece. (Piraeus Container Terminal S.A./Handout via Xinhua)In 2022, China and the EU, who are each other's second-largest trading partners, achieved record bilateral trade flows of 847.3 billion U.S. dollars, marking a year-on-year increase of 2.4 percent. This equates to over 1.6 million U.S. dollars worth of trade conducted on average every minute. Simultaneously, the two-way cumulative stock of direct investment had exceeded 230 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2022.BRI cooperation has significantly enhanced maritime connectivity, fostering flourishing China-EU trade and economic partnership. COSCO Shipping, for instance, now operates 181 container liner routes and allocates over 50 percent of its container capacity to BRI partner countries. The company has also invested in 57 ports within these nations.In 2016, COSCO Shipping acquired a 67-percent stake in Piraeus Port and took over the port's management and operation. In May 2023, COSCO Shipping Ports, the company's ports operator, acquired a nearly 25 percent stake in one of Hamburg's terminals.With the investment from China, Piraeus Port has become a leading European port. Data from the port revealed that in the fiscal year of 2022, its profit after tax had stood at 52.9 million euros, achieving a remarkable 43.9 percent increase from the previous year.This photo taken on Aug. 21, 2023 shows containers loaded on the container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo at Meishan port area of Ningbo Zhoushan Port in east China's Zhejiang Province.

(Photo by Salim/Xinhua)Chinese enterprises have built 12 roads and 21 bridges in Bangladesh, with several transportation projects underway or to be implemented soon, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.by Sun NanDHAKA, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- It used to take Rukhsana Parveen Khan 30 to 45 minutes to reach Bonani from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. Today, the journey is a mere five minutes. "This is excellent," she told Xinhua. "I use this road daily and will benefit greatly from it."The road Khan mentioned is the First Dhaka Elevated Expressway, one of Bangladesh's flagship infrastructure projects, which opened partly to traffic on Sept. 3.Bangladesh's capital and largest city, Dhaka, has a population of nearly 20 million. However, the inadequate road infrastructure has made traffic congestion frequent. "We have to struggle with huge traffic jams every day, so it's terrible for us," said Khan.To solve this problem, the 19.73-km expressway project, with a total investment of 1.263 billion U.S. dollars, was launched on Jan. 1, 2020, under the guidance of the local government. China's Shandong Hi-Speed Group Company Ltd. is the project's leading investor and builder.However, advancing the project was not easy. According to Zheng Xiaozhong, director of Shandong Hi-Speed International Bangladesh Company Limited, a section of the road crosses a railway line with trains passing every 15 minutes on average, leaving almost no time for construction.To solve the issue, the contractor designed an "adjustable mobile door frame" using cast-in-place crossbeams. Thanks to the innovative construction technology, the project's first phase was officially open to traffic in September.Speaking at the expressway's opening, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called it "a new milestone in Bangladesh's city mass transport system," adding that it would play a significant role in developing communication between the capital and the rest of the country.Bangladesh is the first South Asian country to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since then, Bangladesh has made significant progress in Belt and Road cooperation with China, particularly in infrastructure construction.The Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, which passes through Bangladesh's largest Chinese-built Padma Bridge, is one of the most significant projects under construction by China Railway Group Limited and funded by the Export-Import Bank of China.The Bangladeshi government recently launched an experimental passenger train with Chinese-made coaches on a section of the newly constructed mega rail line.This is a "historic moment," Bangladeshi lawmaker Saifuzzaman Shikhar told Xinhua, adding, "I'm crossing the Padma Bridge by train. It was a matter of our past dreams. But it is a reality today."The first section of the railway link is about 80 km long and is expected to be launched in October. The entire 172-km project is scheduled for completion in 2024.It will serve as a vital channel connecting Dhaka and more than 20 districts in the country's south and is expected to greatly promote regional connectivity and economic development.Taking the train, Bangladeshi Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan expressed his hope that China will continue cooperating with Bangladesh.People attend The Belt and Road Initiative in Bangladesh Exhibition 2023 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Sept. 8, 2023. (Xinhua)As an old Chinese proverb goes, "It's better to teach a man how to fish than to give him fish." While improving road traffic, BRI projects in Bangladesh have trained many professionals, including designers and engineers.The runway extension project of Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar Airport, built by two Chinese companies, is Bangladesh's first maritime airport runway expansion project. It will upgrade the domestic airport into the country's fourth international airport upon completion.Project coordinator Musharraf Hussain said, "Working on such a significant project, I learned a lot of technical expertise and management experience that I had not encountered before.""It was a great experience for me and will be a key part of my career," he added.Hussain's story is an example of those inspired by the BRI. Chinese enterprises have shared their own development experience and achievements with their Bangladeshi counterparts to help the country tap its development potential.These projects mentioned above epitomize BRI cooperation between China and Bangladesh in transportation and cultivating talent in the South Asian country.Until now, Chinese enterprises have built 12 roads and 21 bridges in Bangladesh, with several transportation projects underway or to be implemented soon, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.Infrastructure, the bedrock of connectivity, is a priority area of Belt and Road cooperation. Prime Minister Hasina recently said that Belt and Road cooperation has opened a new development door for Bangladesh.■  Workers work on the seafood processing production line at Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. in Fuqing, southeast China's Fujian Province, Aug. 24, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhou Yi)FUZHOU, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- In a farm situated in the Pemalang district of Indonesia's Central Java province, prawn larvae have now reached the age of one and a half months. Once four months old, they will undergo processing and be shipped to Fuzhou, capital city of east China's Fujian Province, about 2,000 nautical miles away.Seasoned prawn farmer Joni Setyawan is in charge of the farm. The 66-year-old has nearly four decades of experience in raising Vannamei prawns. Since 2021, he has been working with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd., focusing on prawn cultivation.The farm in Pemalang district covers around 70,000 square meters. Prawns cultivated here undergo preliminary processing such as cleaning, peeling and frozen packaging at a local plant. Thereafter, vessels carrying these seafood products will embark on a journey of approximately 20 days before arriving at Fuzhou Port."The Vannamei prawns from Indonesia will go through further processing, such as mixing and pounding, and transformed into prawn paste and packaged for quick freezing," said Lin Zhengrong, general manager of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd.Known for its delectable and chewy texture, prawn paste is very popular in the Chinese catering market.Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. has also invested in Vannamei prawn farming in Indonesia, with their farm spanning a vast area of around 4 million square meters.The company established the farm in Indonesia because of the country's warm and humid climate, abundant fisheries resources, short cultivation cycle, and relatively low labor costs. Back in China, the advanced cold chain logistics infrastructure, vast consumer market and mature seafood processing technology can further enhance the value of imported frozen prawn products.Setting up fishery bases in Indonesia has not only increased local employment opportunities but also boosted the income of residents, said Chen Qing'an, the legal representative of the Indonesian subsidiary of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd., noting that the subsidiary has employed more than 300 local workers."I had three prawn ponds, but now I oversee a total of 70 ponds of two farms. My monthly income has multiplied and is very stable," said Joni Setyawan, adding that he has supplied about 1,200 tonnes of Vannamei prawns to China over the past year and a half.Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd. and Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. are among dozens of food companies operating in Fujian's Yuanhong Investment Zone. The zone represents the Chinese part of the "Two Countries, Twin Parks" project jointly undertaken with Indonesia. The Indonesian part involves the Bintan Industrial Estate, the Aviarna Industrial Estate and the Badung Industrial Estate.With the memorandum signed in January 2021, the "Two Countries, Twin Parks" project represents a solid step to synergize the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Indonesia's vision of the Global Maritime Fulcrum. It also serves as an innovative approach to deepening bilateral economic and trade ties, bringing tangible benefits to businesses in both countries.To date, the Chinese park has launched 27 investment projects with a total investment of 55.4 billion yuan (about 7.57 billion U.S. dollars) and 18 trade projects."The 'Two Countries, Twin Parks' project has benefited enterprises inside the industrial parks, offering more streamlined customs clearance services, saving us a significant amount of time," Lin said. ■Workers work on the seafood processing production line at Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd. in Fuqing, southeast China's Fujian Province, Aug. 24, 2023.

(Photo by Zheng Lihao/Xinhua)Gebeyehu Ganga, director-general of Middle East, Asia and Pacific affairs at the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, highlighted the evolution of the BRI since its inception in 2013 into a global platform for open, inclusive, and mutually beneficial international cooperation."As we enter its second decade, the BRI continues to drive socioeconomic development in participating countries, including Ethiopia. Ethiopia, as a gateway to Africa, stands as a pioneer in China-Africa cooperation, serving as a vital connecting hub on the continent and a steadfast partner of China in promoting collaboration through common platforms," he said.Ganga pointed out the tangible benefits of BRI infrastructure and connectivity projects in Ethiopia, particularly citing the Ethiopia-Djibouti standard gauge railway line, which has significantly improved Ethiopia's import-export channels.He said the BRI played an important role in catalyzing Ethiopia's development aspirations by supporting the establishment of industrial parks and laying the groundwork for the growth of manufacturing industries in the East African country."In the realm of people-to-people exchanges, a cornerstone of the BRI, China has been instrumental in supporting Ethiopia's educational and cultural development. Scholarships offered by the Chinese government underscore the depth of cooperation between our two nations," Ganga added.The symposium reflected on the achievements of the BRI over the past decade and discussed strategies for advancing a high-quality and more innovative BRI agenda in the future, aiming to foster practical and beneficial development towards a community of shared future between the two countries.Xu Jianping, director-general of the Department of Regional Opening-up at the National Development and Reform Commission of China, emphasized the results of cooperation with China under the BRI in Ethiopia. He reiterated China's commitment to implementing high-quality BRI cooperation as the initiative enters its second decade.Officials and scholars from Ethiopia and China attend a BRI-themed symposium in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on March 20, 2024.

It has pictures of a peacock, flowers and trees drawn in clear Chinese painting styles.The bottle is strikingly similar in design to a Chinese counterpart at the Ningxia Museum: a brown glazed ceramic vase with flower patterns dating to the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) and discovered in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region."The closeness of these ancient ceramics in Syria and Ningxia is one example of close exchanges between China and the West Asian region up to the Mediterranean in ancient times," said Wang Yi, head of the display department of the Ningxia Museum."Many relics unearthed here have also been proven to be imports from Persia, Iraq and Syria, and even the Eastern Roman Empire," said Wang.At a parallel exhibition of ancient Ningxia heritage at the museum, one can see a long-necked glass bottle and a glass hanging bottle, believed to have been imported from West Asia during the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907)."The earliest glass relic unearthed in Ningxia is a 6th-century glass plate from Persia," Wang said.A total of 97 pieces or sets of cultural relics from Syria, including stoneware, bronzeware and statues, are currently on display at the Ningxia Museum in Yinchuan, capital of Ningxia. Several cultural relics unearthed in Ningxia are also displayed to shed light on the cultural and trade exchanges between China and Syria in history."China and Syria enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges. This exhibition provides an important window through which visitors can appreciate the splendid history and civilization of Syria up close, and experience the exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations," said Tan Ping, director of Art Exhibitions China, which co-hosted the exhibition with the Ningxia regional government.Su Xiaomei, a local historian with the Guyuan Museum of Ningxia, whose relics are also on display at the Ningxia Museum, said, "This exhibition also offers a chance to hold dialogue on the role of the Silk Road in building over 2,000 years of exchanges between the people of China and Syria, which is more significant considering the Belt and Road Initiative of modern time." ■     Students attend a free class given by Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Educational and Cultural Exchange Base in the carriage of a running Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU train in Indonesia, Oct. 24, 2023. (Xinhua/Xu Qin)by Xinhua writers Xu Qin, Yu QianliangJAKARTA, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian teenagers feel the charm of "China Speed" and light up their dreams for the future.On Tuesday, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Educational and Cultural Exchange Base brought a free class to the Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School in West Bandung Regency, West Java Province.Chinese high-speed rail technical experts from China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) Sifang Co., Ltd., the company which designed and manufactured Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU trains, visited the school campus to give HSR science courses to local students, and led Indonesian teenagers to experience the immersive charm of "China Speed" on a running Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU train."Boys and girls, who can tell me why the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway trains can run so fast?" In the class, Zhang Fangtao, chief designer of Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU trains, got a new identity as a science teacher who lectured on the HSR science.In the classroom which is near to a traditional railway line and Jakarta-Bandung HSR's Padalarang Station, the curious students listened carefully to their science teacher and actively raised their hands to answer questions.The vibe in the 40 sq m classroom was lively with frequent interactions and Q&As between Zhang and students, punctuated by rounds of laughter and applause.Saskia, a 15-year-old 9th grader, said, "Cutting the journey between Jakarta and Bandung from more than three hours to about 40 minutes is just cool, I do think high-speed train is a good choice for many people."The classroom teaching was followed by an on-site experience inside the carriage of a running EMU train from Jakarta-Bandung HSR's Padalarang Station to Halim Station. The laughter of the teenagers and the shutter sound of their mobile phones filled the entire carriage of the fast moving train past fields, rivers, mountains, plains of Java Island.Zhang, once again, lectured on the HSR science, but this time the classroom was moving, on a real high-speed train, only to find that he had to grab the teenagers' attention from frequent exclamations and fleeting scenery outside the train window."After the commercial operation started last week, I finally had the opportunity to ride the high-speed train. During the free ride phase, my parents tried in vain to get a ticket for me," said Rayi, 14, another 9th grader. "I learned a lot about HSR today in the class and on the train, and I can't wait to be a business person in the future to travel by the high-speed train."Besides the lectures in and outside the classroom, CRRC Sifang has donated teaching materials including computers and sound systems to Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School.The school is a small public school having hundreds of students and only a few classrooms used by students of Grade 7-9 on a rotating basis."I am very grateful to these Chinese companies for supporting the development of education in West Bandung. CRRC Sifang donates teaching materials to our school, which can help us to improve the quality of education," said Mepi, head of the junior high school."The HSR lectures and experience helped broaden the students' horizons, opening the door to a new world for our kids."Asep Wahyu, West Bandung Regency's economy and development assistant, said, "It is really generous for CRRC Sifang to provide assistance to our local school. The teaching materials and the free class will help our students study better.""I heard that Chinese people would call their kids 'flowers of the country', and Indonesian people has a similar saying as calling our children 'buds of the country', be it flower or bud, they are the future, they are our hope," Asep added.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR is a "golden brand" of China-Indonesia cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by China. It is the first high-speed railway in Indonesia and Southeast Asia at large. CRRC Sifang, as a party of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR project, designs and manufactures high-speed EMU trains with a maximum operating speed of 350 km per hour for the railway."The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway is not only a symbol of win-win cooperation between China and Indonesia, but also a connecting bridge to enhance the friendship between our two nations," said Cao Rui, CRRC Sifang's deputy general manager.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR, jointly built by China and Indonesia, was officially put into commercial operation on Oct. 17.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU Educational and Cultural Exchange Base was established in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia on Sept. 9. ■Students from Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School take photos and videos of a Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train on the platform of Padalarang Station in Padalarang, Indonesia, Oct. 24, 2023.

(Xinhua/Han Xu)The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released by the African Union and the United Nations migration agency.ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released Tuesday by the African Union (AU) and the United Nations migration agency.The second edition of the Africa Migration Report, jointly launched by the AU and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, noted that migration in Africa remains a complex phenomenon, with multiple drivers shaping people's decisions about movement within and outside the continent.According to the report, one key characteristic of African migration is that the majority of international migrants engage in intra-African migration. It noted that African countries have more emigrants than immigrants, with a level of international migration lower than the global average.Data from the report showed that about 25.1 million people, accounting for about 1.9 percent of the 1.3 billion people who live in Africa, live outside the countries where they were born, which remained below the global corresponding share of 3.6 percent as of 2020."African migrants do migrate outside the continent, although at a slightly lower extent than within Africa, while limited immigration to Africa from abroad occurs," the report said.This photo, taken on Feb. 18, 2024, shows the twilight scenery at Friendship Square in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Li Yahui)Meanwhile, the report underscored that migration plays a major role in the development of African countries of origin as migrants continue to maintain strong relationships with relatives back in their countries and communities of origin, eventually contributing to development there.It noted that migrants' role in development comes in the form of remittances, as well as through the sharing of knowledge and ideas between receiving and origin countries.The report also highlighted that while the African continent is home to some of the most promising developments in regional cooperation and collaboration, the continent is also home to some of the most intricate contemporary patterns of human mobility.Noting the crucial need for policymakers to have a clear sense of the nature of the challenges associated with human mobility, the report underscored the need to "fully understand and manage mobility in ways that are just, inclusive and that place the welfare of the African people front and center."  ■  Once a humble fishing village in China's tropical island province of Hainan, Boao now welcomes visitors from both nearby and afar.

Hence the necessity came to establish a kind of a “forum for Asia” that could bring Asian countries together, build consensus, explore solutions and inspire policies and actions. The ultimate purpose would be to achieve Asian economic integration. An economically integrated Asia, they believe, is not only the firewall against similar crises, but also the best way to promote economic development and well-being in each and every Asian country.For the past 23 years, the Boao Forum for Asia has put forward many valuable proposals in putting together Asian consensus, promoting cooperation among all parties, enhancing economic globalization and building a community with a shared future for mankind. It has played an important role in strengthening exchanges and cooperation among Asian countries and other parts of the world, ultimately promoting Asian economic integration.Innovation, health, culture, education, media and economic security appear high on the much-expanded agenda of the BFA. Each spring, the annual conference in Boao brings together more than 2,000 world-renowned participants, including presidents, prime ministers, ministers, heads of international organizations, CEOs, economists, scientists and technology pioneers for a four-day extensive, in-depth and forward-looking grand brainstorming on the most pressing issues in Asia and the world.Xinhuanet: Despite global economic slowdown, the macroeconomic fundamentals of Asian economies are still generally good and have shown strong resilience. Many believe Asia remains the major driving force behind world economic recovery. What is your opinion and what do you think Asia’s economic integration can bring to the world?Ban Ki-Moon: On January 1, 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect, and the world's largest free trade area officially set off. This marked a historic step to re-boost Asia’s economic growth after the COVID pandemic. Against the backdrop of multiple obstacles posed to the multilateral trading system, RCEP has greatly improved the level of intra-regional trade facilitation, and is constantly showing the dividends of intra-regional trade and investment opening up.Asian countries have also demonstrated solidarity in the face of crisis and extended a cooperative spirit to one another. And quite a few Asian countries are front-runners in digital technology and digitalization of the economy. Asia is now developing as one of the most dynamic, most vigorous regions with huge potential to be tapped across the world, and the region will not only remain the growth locomotive of the world, but promises to be a more integrated economic powerhouse.Xinhuanet: What do you think of China’s role in powering world post-pandemic economic growth? How do you see the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years?Ban Ki-Moon: In the past year, when the world economy was recovering slowly and protectionism was on the rise, China and other developing countries stayed committed to anchoring development issues and promoting international cooperation, injecting impetus into world economic growth and common development. As the world’s second largest economy, what China does and will do is of global significance. There are many notable signs that China is switching its economy from high-speed growth to high-quality growth, and it is encouraging “new quality productive forces” to boost and transform into a more innovation-driven, balanced, inclusive, green and open development, dependent more on scientific and technological progress.A series of major initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are in line with the general trend and aim to promote win-win cooperation among partners, so that people can achieve peace, mutual respect and common prosperity under the mechanism of multilateralism. Only by upholding genuine multilateralism can we better respond to the growing number of global challenges and safeguard global security.Xinhuanet: In recent years, new breakthroughs have been made in the frontier fields of global scientific and technological development such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In your view, how should Asian countries embrace scientific and technological innovation and respond to the risks and challenges posed by scientific and technological development?Ban Ki-Moon: We are in a world of great changes. Perhaps one of the most dramatic and fundamental changes is the looming technological revolution. Though not sure when, where and how this technological revolution will take place, one thing is certain: we’re on the cusp of it. Today, several technological advances have risen to the fore and reshaped the way we work and live. AI, big data, quantum computing, new materials, renewables and life sciences are indispensable part and parcel of our life and economy, playing an increasingly important role. Someday, in the not-too-remote future, they will combine into a technological revolution that fundamentally changes the world and our future.There is no bucking the trend. Wise people do not resist changes, but adapt to and utilize them. Technological revolutions in the past centuries have disrupted the old and traditional, but generated the new and the better. All technological revolutions have brought unprecedented material progress and well-being to mankind. This looming technological revolution we’re looking forward to will be no exception.There is no underestimating the risks and challenges coming along with it. Our planet is getting increasingly “small” as the world gets more and more interdependent and interconnected. Living in this increasingly interconnected world, we're all in the same boat and our future is shared. There is no alternative to cooperation. The zero-sum game must not be our option and give way to win-win. Only through win-win cooperation and concerted efforts can we effectively cope with the challenges that come along with the new revolutionary technologies and make better use of the technologies to the benefit of humankind. The fundamental sense of human beings should be kept.       BOAO, Hainan, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economy is expected to grow by around 4.5 percent in 2024, surpassing that of 2023, and continue to be the largest contributor to global economic growth, according to a report released Tuesday by the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), which convenes its 2024 conference in Boao, a resort town in southern China's Hainan Province.  According to the forum's Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress flagship report, despite facing various external economic challenges, the Asian economy will still maintain a relatively high growth rate, supported by relatively strong consumption and proactive fiscal policies.  The report forecasts that by region, the economic growth rate of East Asia is expected to be the same as that of 2023, at 4.3 percent; South Asia's economic growth is anticipated to rise from 5.4 percent in 2023 to 5.8 percent, maintaining its position as the fastest-growing region in Asia. Meanwhile, Central Asia's economic growth is likely to decelerate to 4.3 percent from 4.5 percent in 2023, while the economic growth in West Asia is expected to rise to 3.5 percent from 2.5 percent in 2023.  "In terms of purchasing power parity, Asia's economic aggregate is expected to account for 49 percent of global GDP in 2024, marking a 0.5 percentage points increase from 2023," the report said.  In terms of trade and investment, Asia is expected to reverse the downward trend in 2023, the report said, explaining that the accelerated development of digital trade, the recovery of tourism in Asia, the continuous advancements of economic and trade arrangements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the positive effects of the restructuring of Asian value chains and industrial chains on regional economic integration, are expected to gradually emerge and add new impetus to Asian trade and investment.  In terms of employment, the report said that due to the ongoing economic downturn, the global employment outlook for 2024 is not particularly optimistic, projecting relatively sluggish employment growth in 2024 in the populous regions of East and South Asia that may dampen Asia's overall employment growth. "But the overall unemployment rate in Asia is expected to remain below the global level," the report said.  In terms of income, the report said that income growth "remains under considerable pressure," despite an increase in total weekly working hours of full-time jobs in most Asian regions. Given the wide variance in sectoral incomes, domestic income inequality within Asian economies could further exacerbate, it warned.  The report also forecast that overall, inflation pressure in most Asian economies is expected to ease further in 2024, noting that economies currently experiencing lower inflation are projected to witness an uptick.  With a founding purpose to promote economic integration in Asia, the mission of the BFA, is to pool positive energy for the development of Asia and the world.

Hence the necessity came to establish a kind of a “forum for Asia” that could bring Asian countries together, build consensus, explore solutions and inspire policies and actions.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)TIANJIN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping has extended Spring Festival greetings to all Chinese people during his inspection tour in north China's Tianjin Municipality from Thursday to Friday.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, wished Chinese people of all ethnic groups, compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese good health and happiness in the Year of the Dragon, and the motherland prosperity.On Thursday morning, Xi visited a village in Xinkou Town in the municipality's Xiqing District.From late July to early August last year, extreme rainfall hit northern China, causing anomalous floods in the Haihe River Basin, and a large area of land in the flood storage and detention basins in Tianjin was inundated.Briefed about the impact of floods on the city and district, Xi walked into greenhouses to check the growth of vegetables. He asked the farmers in detail about the restoration of greenhouses and the reseeding and sales of vegetables.Xi then visited a villager's home, where he chatted with four generations of the family. He inquired about the family's losses during the disaster, their post-disaster production and income, and carefully tallied the numbers during the talk.Stressing the importance of ensuring the people's livelihoods, Xi said the issue is always on the mind of the CPC Central Committee as well as Party committees and governments at all levels. He also expressed the hope that villagers would make their own efforts to rebuild their beautiful homes.Before Xi left the village, the villagers gathered around and greeted him. Xi said he was happy to see the successful restoration of life and production and that winter heating had been ensured for the residents.Since last year, the country has been hit by natural disasters such as floods, typhoons, earthquakes, landslides and snowstorms, Xi said, adding that he is keeping a close eye on them.As the Spring Festival approaches, Xi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended his sincere regards to all those affected by disasters and those at the forefront of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction.On Thursday afternoon, Xi went to an ancient cultural street and visited local distinctive shops, learning about the products, their sales, and the development of traditional culture.Speaking of the importance of carrying forward fine traditional Chinese culture in realizing Chinese modernization, Xi asked Tianjin to better preserve and utilize blocks with historical and cultural interest.In Chinese culture, the upcoming lunar year will be the Year of the Dragon, and the dragon symbolizes bravery, progress, boundless vitality, and auspiciousness, conveying optimistic aspirations for the future, Xi said, encouraging the residents to embrace the new year with confidence and strive toward an even better life.On Friday morning, Xi visited the Peking-Tianjin Campaign Memorial Museum, where he underscored the necessity of studying and frequently reviewing the history of China's revolutionary war. The revolutionary traditions should be carried on and the fighting spirit should be strengthened, he said.On Friday afternoon, Xi was briefed by the Party committee and the government of Tianjin about their work, and affirmed the achievements that Tianjin has made in various areas.Xi urged Tianjin to focus on the central work of economic development and the primary task of high-quality development, and write its own chapter in advancing Chinese modernization.As a base of research and development for advanced manufacturing, Tianjin should be a pioneer in developing new productive forces, Xi said. He called for sci-tech and industrial innovation and the development of high-end, smart and green manufacturing.Tianjin should coordinate with Beijing to promote sci-tech innovation and the integration of the two cities' industrial systems, Xi said.Reform and opening up is the fundamental force that propels the development of all causes, Xi stressed.He called on Tianjin to make further progress in improving the basic systems underpinning the market economy, developing a new system for a higher-standard open economy, and promoting regional integration and innovation in mechanisms and institutions that support Beijing-Tianjin urban integration.Tianjin should also make an in-depth exploration into its historical and cultural resources, and strengthen the protection of its historical and cultural legacies as well as cultural resources related to the Party's heritage, Xi said.Tianjin should act on the principle that a city should be built by the people and for the people, said Xi, adding that efforts are needed to expand basic public services, safeguard people's well-being and boost the sense of fulfillment among the people.Stressing the importance of ensuring people's security and livelihood needs, supply of goods and energy, as well as social harmony and stability, Xi said that efforts should be made to ensure a joyful and peaceful Spring Festival.Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection tour. ■Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, learns about the recovery of farming activities after last year's floods when visiting a village in Xinkou Town in Xiqing District of north China's Tianjin Municipality, Feb. 1, 2024.

(Xinhua/Shen Hong)HANOI, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) came to a successful conclusion in late October, 2022, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong became the first foreign leader to visit China.This time, the state visit to Vietnam as the successful culmination of China's diplomatic efforts this year is of great importance, said General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday as he concluded his two-day state visit to Vietnam.Xi made the remarks as he and his wife, Peng Liyuan, bid farewell to Trong and his wife, Ngo Thi Man, before returning to China.Throughout the years, leaders of both parties and countries have consistently maintained close communication, reaching numerous crucial agreements to guide the cooperative development of bilateral ties.Noting that it is a good tradition for leaders of the two parties to draw up plans for the development of relations between the two parties and countries, Xi pointed out that during this visit, he and Trong jointly announced the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.The decision has brought China-Vietnam relations to a new historical starting point and will push China-Vietnam relations to a new level, Xi said.The announcement came as the two sides are marking the 15th anniversary of establishing a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. China was the first country to forge such a partnership with Vietnam, the latter's highest level of diplomatic ties.Over the past 15 years since the inception of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, Vietnam and China have made substantial progress in cooperation in various fields, laying a solid foundation for both sides to push bilateral relations into a new stage, said Dao Ngoc Bau, deputy director in charge of the Institute of International Relations under the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics.During Xi's visit, both leaders quoted on several occasions late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's well-known remarks, which defined China-Vietnam relations as a bond of "camaraderie plus brotherhood."Xi said that what impressed him most was Trong's repeated emphasis that the China-Vietnam bond of "camaraderie plus brotherhood" is the starting point and foundation of the China-Vietnam relationship.As long as the two sides continue to steadfastly follow this path, China-Vietnam relations will surely achieve new developments, bringing greater benefits to the people of both countries, Xi said, thanking Trong and his wife for "the warmest reception and most grand hospitality" during the visit.Xi added that he stands ready to continue to maintain close communication with Trong through various flexible means.On the second day of his visit, apart from meeting senior Vietnamese officials including Chairman of National Assembly of Vietnam Vuong Dinh Hue, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong, Xi also met with representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to China-Vietnam friendship.The foundation of China-Vietnam friendship lies among their people and the future of this friendship will be created by the young people, Xi said during his meeting with those representatives together with Trong.As he said goodbye to Xi and his wife, Trong congratulated Xi on the complete success of his visit.Noting that Xi's visit had a tight schedule and far-reaching significance, Trong said that they had not only witnessed the signing of dozens of bilateral cooperation documents, but further enhanced mutual understanding and trust.The decision to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance is of decisive significance to the future relations between the two countries, he said.Noting that no long ago, he and Xi met with representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to China-Vietnam friendship, Trong expressed hope that they will inherit the traditional friendship of comrades plus brothers between the two countries and carry forward the cause of Vietnam-China friendship. ■     General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a key speech during a meeting with representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to the China-Vietnam friendship in Hanoi, Vietnam, Dec. 13, 2023.

(Xinhua/Shen Hong)HANOI, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president, said here on Wednesday that the foundation of China-Vietnam friendship lies among their two peoples and the future of this friendship will be created by the young people.Xi made the remarks while delivering a key speech during a meeting with representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to the China-Vietnam friendship.Upon Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan's arrival at the National Convention Center, they were warmly welcomed by Vietnamese youth representatives. Xi and Peng, along with General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong and his wife, Ngo Thi Man, took group photos with the representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to the China-Vietnam friendship.On behalf of the CPC and the Chinese government, Xi extended his warm regards to the old and new friends who are committed to China-Vietnam friendship. He pointed out that on Tuesday he and Trong jointly announced their decision to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, thus ushering in a new stage in the relations between the two parties and countries.This is a major strategic decision they have made to revitalize world socialism and ensure the long-term stability and security of the two countries, Xi said, adding that it is rooted in the two countries' traditional friendship and represents the shared interests and aspirations of the two peoples.In the past, the two countries stood by and reached out to each other as they pursued common goals together, he said, adding in modern times, the two parties and peoples stayed true to their common ideals, and supported each other in trying times as they fought for national independence and liberation.Today, while reading the famous poetic line by late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh that "so profound is the friendship between Vietnam and China, because we are both comrades and brothers," the memory of those fiery and exciting years of the two peoples is kept alive, Xi continued, adding that the two countries remain firmly committed to their shared aspiration forged in the early days and are pursuing win-win cooperation.Since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership 15 years ago, the CPC and the CPV have pursued people-centered mutually beneficial cooperation, delivering true benefits to the two peoples, he noted, saying that looking ahead, it can be seen that the two countries share the same future.China is now striving to build itself into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts by pursuing Chinese modernization, and Vietnam, on its part, is vigorously advancing its industrialization and modernization drive, he continued.China will stay committed to peaceful development, the policy of forging friendships and partnerships with neighbors, and the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. And China is ready to share more of the benefits of Chinese modernization with its neighbors, Xi noted.Stressing the foundation of bilateral friendship lies among the two peoples, and the future of this friendship will be created by the young people, Xi expressed three wishes to the youth of the two countries.First, it is hoped that the two countries' youth will carry forward bilateral friendship and play their part in building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.With remarkable economic and social advances, China and Vietnam demonstrate to the world that they have found the right development paths, Xi said, adding that enhanced solidarity and cooperation will strengthen their socialist causes.He also voiced hopes that people committed to the China-Vietnam friendship in various sectors in both countries, especially the young people, will take the lead in promoting bilateral friendship, and contribute to the two countries' respective hundred-year pursuit of development goals and to the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.Second, it is hoped that the two countries' youth will play their part in promoting the development of the Asia-Pacific and contribute to enduring peace in the region.Noting that the two countries have made tremendous achievements through, respectively, China's reform and opening up and Vietnam's Doi Moi (reform) policy, Xi said this is credited not only to their own endeavors, but also to a peaceful, open and inclusive Asia-Pacific, adding that the Asia-Pacific is the place which the two countries call home, and openness, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation are the right course to follow.The two countries should strive to build an Asia-Pacific community, create more momentum to boost solidarity and make advances, and make greater contributions to making the Asia-Pacific more harmonious and prosperous, he added.Third, it is hoped that the two countries' youth will be pioneers in promoting human progress and contribute to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.Noting that the two parties are both Marxist parties that bear in mind the overall interests of the world, and the two countries are both responsible members of the international community, Xi said that they should play a major role in advancing human progress, and should be visionary, look beyond the horizon and shoulder responsibilities entrusted by the times, stand up for international fairness and justice, and contribute their share to global development.Xi emphasized that keeping in mind the journey traversed will enable the two countries to advance along the right path, adding that the challenging paths China and Vietnam have traveled and the remarkable achievements they have made in developing socialism fully demonstrate that enhanced solidarity and cooperation between the two countries has enabled them to overcome all risks and challenges and to move from one victory to another.Xi said the two countries should pursue their respective path to socialism and deliver the gains of industrialization and modernization to more people in the two countries, calling on the two sides to join hands and make even greater contributions to the advancement of humanity.For his part, Trong said under the leadership of the Communist Party, Vietnam and China have consistently supported each other in their struggles for national independence, liberation, and socialist construction. The Vietnam-China friendship is as deep as comrades and brothers, and Vietnam always remembers and appreciates the invaluable support that China has provided over the years, he added.Over the 15 years since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, the two countries' political mutual trust has been increasingly strengthened, and practical cooperation has yielded fruitful results, he said, noting that these days, the streets and alleys of Hanoi were filled with a joyous and warm atmosphere, and Xi's state visit to Vietnam has achieved a complete success.The joint announcement the two leaders made to build a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance represents a historic milestone in Vietnam-China relations, Trong said, adding that it is bound to bring greater tangible benefits to the two peoples and make greater contributions to the cause of global peace and progress.The future of Vietnam-China relations will be created by the young people, Trong pointed out, expressing his hope that the young people of both countries can deeply understand and carry forward the profound friendship established by the older generation of the two countries' leaders, so as to inject new vitality into the long-term stable development of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between Vietnam and China and the continuous growth of the socialist causes of both countries.Representatives from both countries reported to the two leaders on bilateral friendly exchanges. They said that during Xi's historic state visit to Vietnam, the general secretaries of both parties took time to personally meet with friendly individuals and youth representatives from China and Vietnam, fully reflecting the high regard and earnest hope of the leaders of the two countries and parties for the young people and friendship cause of China and Vietnam.The two general secretaries announced the building of a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, which aligns with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the two peoples, conforms to the trend of peace, cooperation and development, and will undoubtedly guide bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to embark on an even better new journey, setting an example of amicable and sincere relations between neighboring countries, they noted.The youth of both countries will carry forward the traditional friendship featuring "camaraderie plus brotherhood," engage in close interactions, strengthen mutual learning and exchange, deepen mutual trust and friendship, and actively work towards the goal of "stronger popular support" as proposed by the two general secretaries, so as to make positive efforts and contributions towards building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future, they added. ■General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese President Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong and their spouses pose for group photos with the representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to the China-Vietnam friendship in Hanoi, Vietnam, Dec. 13, 2023.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)HANOI, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese president, said here Wednesday that China and Vietnam should join hands to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.To achieve that, the two sides should strengthen political guidance, enhance solidarity and cooperation, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, better communicate with the people and properly manage differences, Xi made the remarks in talks with Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong.Xi noted that on Tuesday he and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong jointly announced the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, raising the relations between the two parties and two countries up to a new stage.The Chinese and Vietnamese people have fought side by side in their struggles for national independence and liberation, and supported each other in the cause of socialist revolution and construction, Xi said, noting that such a commitment to each other through thick and thin has forged a friendship featuring "camaraderie plus brotherhood."To build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance is to renew the shared will of the older generation of leaders of the two parties and countries, to pay tribute to the heroic past, and to carry forward the revolutionary friendship between the two countries, Xi said.It is also a major historic decision made by the leadership of the two parties and countries, bearing in mind the larger interests of the long-term development of China-Vietnam relations and the strategic overall picture of solidarity of socialist forces in the world, and it meets the common needs of China and Vietnam to advance their respective modernization and serves the common interests of the two peoples, he added.Xi stressed that the two sides need to fully appreciate the historical imperative, strategic significance, immediate necessity and international responsibilities of building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future. Focusing on the six major goals of greater political mutual trust, more substantive security cooperation, deeper practical cooperation, more solid popular foundation, closer multilateral coordination and collaboration, and more proper management of differences, the two sides need to continue to develop the bilateral relationship in new historical contexts, and jointly advance the China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance to bring about more benefits to the two peoples.Xi then underscored the following points:First, it is important to strengthen political guidance and rally strategic consensus on building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future. The leadership of the two parties and countries need to continue to maintain in-depth strategic communication through flexible ways, increase mutual learning, deepen the exchange of experience in party and state governance, and jointly improve the modernization of the system and capacity for governance to better serve the development of their respective countries.Second, it is important to enhance solidarity and coordination to safeguard the China-Vietnam community with a shared future. China and Vietnam are both socialist countries under the leadership of a communist party. It is their shared responsibility and mission to safeguard the security of the political system and defend the cause of socialism. The two sides should strengthen solidarity, stay committed to openness and mutual benefits, jointly guard against external infiltration and sabotage attempts, and make due contributions to strengthening world socialist forces and promoting peace and the progress of humanity.Third, it is important to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to make the pie of interests bigger for the China-Vietnam community with a shared future. The two sides need to strengthen top-level design, ensure the sound implementation of the outline program for synergizing the Belt and Road Initiative and the Two Corridors and One Economic Circle strategy, speed up infrastructure connectivity, and expand the export of quality agricultural products from Vietnam to China. Cooperation should also be enhanced in the digital economy and green development to explore new growth drivers for bilateral practical cooperation.Fourth, it is important to better communicate with the people and build a stronger social foundation for the China-Vietnam community with a shared future. It is important to take a systematic approach to advance people-to-people friendship between China and Vietnam. We should step up public awareness campaigns on the traditional friendship between the two countries and two parties, make good use of culture, tourism, sub-national cooperation and other platforms to build more bridges for exchange between the two peoples, especially between the younger generation, to deepen mutual understanding and friendship.Fifth, it is important to properly manage differences and ensure a more stable expectation on the China-Vietnam community with a shared future. As important coastal countries of the South China Sea, China and Vietnam share common interests and shoulder common responsibilities in safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea. China will strengthen communication and coordination with Vietnam to find long-term solutions to maritime issues that both sides can accept, work with all parties for an early conclusion on a substantive and effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and make greater contributions to regional peace and stability. ■Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese president, holds talks with Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, Dec. 13, 2023.

(Xinhua/Liu Weibing)HANOI, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president, said here Wednesday that China and Vietnam, under new circumstances, should move forward on the path of friendship and cooperation from the strategic and long-term perspective of the relationship.In his meeting with Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam Vuong Dinh Hue, Xi said the two sides should ensure sound steering of the bilateral relationship, advance practical cooperation and properly managing problems and differences.Upon arriving at the National Assembly Building, Xi was warmly greeted by Hue and Vietnamese people from different quarters.Xi noted that China and Vietnam share the same political system, similar aspirations and philosophies and an intertwined future. Relations with each other hold a special place in their respective party-to-party and state-to-state relations.Over the past 73 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, he said, the traditional friendship between China and Vietnam has been further enriched through mutual support and assistance in the struggle for national independence and liberation, and further deepened as the two sides move forward comprehensive strategic cooperation to advance the socialist causes.This year marks the 15th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between China and Vietnam, Xi said, adding the announcement that he and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong made on Tuesday to build the China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance sends a positive message of solidarity, friendship and common development between China and Vietnam as two socialist countries.Xi highlighted the need for the two sides to, under the new circumstances, move forward on the path of friendship and cooperation from the strategic and long-term perspective of the relationship.First, ensuring sound steering of the bilateral relationship. It is important to take stock of the fine traditions and good practices in bilateral relations, step up high-level strategic communication, share experience on the governance of parties and countries, explore ways to enrich the theories and practices of socialist development, uphold common strategic interests, and keep the bilateral relationship on the right track, he noted.Second, advancing practical cooperation. Both China and Vietnam are at a critical stage in their reform and development. There are both inherent advantages and realistic needs for mutually beneficial cooperation, he said. The two sides need to deliver on the outcomes of the visit, strengthen cooperation in such areas as connectivity, industrial and supply chains and green economy, and increase the two peoples' sense of benefit, Xi added.Third, properly managing problems and differences. It is important to translate the understandings and desires of the leadership of the two parties and countries into concrete actions, advance cooperation while managing differences, and steadily take forward maritime cooperation, especially joint development, he continued.Xi pointed out that in recent years, the National People's Congress (NPC) of China and National Assembly of Vietnam have maintained good interactions and steadily enhanced exchanges and cooperation at various levels.It is hoped that the two legislatures will further deepen exchanges and cooperation, draw upon each other's useful experience in legislation and supervision, do more to forge closer bonds between the two peoples, and contribute to improving the modernized governance systems and capabilities respectively and to cementing the popular foundation for building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future, Xi added.For his part, Hue, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, warmly welcomed Xi's state visit to Vietnam. He noted that Xi's visit is one by the top party and state leader of China after the successful conclusion of the 20th CPC National Congress, and one that coincides with the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam-China comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.Hue said that on Tuesday, Xi and Trong agreed on the new characterization of the elevated relationship between the two parties and two countries -- jointly building a Vietnam-China community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.This takes forward the special friendship of camaraderie plus brotherhood forged by the older-generation leaders, and will steer the relationship in the direction of steady development in the long run and toward a brighter future, Hue said.The Vietnamese side identifies with the CPC on its governance philosophy, sincerely congratulates China on its remarkable achievements, and firmly believes that China will realize the goal of building a great modern socialist country in all respects as scheduled.Hue expressed confidence that the CPC and China, as a major responsible party and country, will make greater contributions to world peace and development. The relationship between the National Assembly of Vietnam and the NPC of China is an important part of the Vietnam-China comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, he added.Vietnam's National Assembly will follow through on the important common understandings of the two general secretaries, step up exchange and cooperation with the NPC on democracy, rule of law and anti-corruption, further build consensus across the sectors, consolidate the traditional friendship and strategic mutual trust between the two countries, and cement the popular foundation of building a Vietnam-China community with a shared future, Hue said. ■Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chinese president, meets with Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam Vuong Dinh Hue in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, Dec. 13, 2023.

Upon Xi's arrival in Hanoi, he had a meeting with Trong on Tuesday. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)HANOI, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Vietnam on Tuesday agreed to build a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance.The two sides have announced the new positioning of relations between the two parties and countries and agreed to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance on the basis of deepening the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two sides.The announcement was made during the ongoing state visit to Vietnam by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president.Xi attended a welcome ceremony held by General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong.After the ceremony, Xi held a meeting with Trong. Xi said he is delighted to visit Vietnam as promised and complete the third round of mutual visits between the two leaders. China is pleased with the achievements made by Vietnam in the past nearly 40 years of "Doi Moi," the country's reform cause, especially since the 13th National Congress of the CPV, Xi said.China firmly supports Vietnam in continuing to advance the cause of socialist construction, Xi said. He expressed confidence that under the firm leadership of the CPV with General Secretary Trong at the helm, the Vietnamese party and government will successfully implement the major goals and tasks set by the 13th National Party Congress of the CPV, laying a solid foundation for the successful realization of the two 100-year goals.China and Vietnam have supported each other in their respective struggles for national independence and liberation, and have learned from each other in their respective undertakings of reform and opening-up as well as innovation, Xi said.Xi said China always sees its ties with Vietnam from a strategic and long-term perspective, noting that at present, changes in the world, times and history are unfolding in an unprecedented manner.As the world's top two ruling Communist parties, both the CPC and the CPV have been adhering to and developing Marxism, unswervingly following the path of socialism, and leading their respective country in socialist construction, said Xi.All the more, the two parties should grasp the special strategic significance of China-Vietnam relations and make solid progress in building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future from the perspective of strengthening the socialist forces in the world and ensuring the steady and long-term progress of their respective cause of socialist construction, Xi added.Xi said with joint efforts, China-Vietnam ties will enter a new stage of greater political mutual trust, more solid security cooperation, deeper mutually beneficial cooperation, stronger popular support, closer multilateral coordination and better handling of differences.Xi also said that the cause of socialist construction in China and Vietnam will advance steadily and make new contributions to the stability, development and prosperity of the region and the world at large.Xi made a six-point proposal on building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future, the first of which is to keep to the right political direction.China and Vietnam should adhere to high-level strategic guidance, strengthen exchanges and mutual learning on the governance of party and state, and jointly deepen understanding of the ruling laws of Communist parties, as well as the laws of socialist construction and the development of human society, Xi said.The two countries should firmly support one another on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and jointly uphold international equity and justice, he said.Both sides should also deepen mutual trust on security, Xi said.The two sides must prioritize national political security, ensure the red flag of socialism not to be changed, and spare no effort to prevent, defuse and contain all kinds of political and security risks, he said.China firmly supports Vietnam in maintaining social stability and ethnic unity, and believes Vietnam will continue to support China in opposing external interference and firmly advancing the great cause of national reunification, he said.Xi said the two countries should upgrade practical cooperation.The modernization that includes the whole of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people is a great opportunity brought by China to the world, he said, adding that China is willing to share opportunities and seek common development with its Vietnamese comrades.An active alignment with the eight major steps to support high-quality Belt and Road cooperation by the Vietnamese side is welcomed, Xi said, calling for expanding cooperation in such emerging areas as digital economy and green development.The two sides should jointly implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, safeguard the global trading system, and build a secure, stable, unimpeded, efficient, open, inclusive and mutually beneficial global industrial chain and supply chain, he said.China will continue to encourage competent Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Vietnam and hopes that Vietnam will provide a good business environment for Chinese enterprises, he added.The Chinese president also called for more input to cement the popular support for China-Vietnam friendship.Bilateral cooperation should have a heavier focus on agriculture, education, health care and other fields concerning people's livelihood, Xi said, adding that the two sides should strengthen cooperation in such areas as youth, tourism as well as at the local level, deepen the two peoples' understanding on a China-Vietnam community with a shared future and on the traditional friendship between the two parties and countries, and enhance the bonds between the young generation of the two countries, to cement the popular support for China-Vietnam friendship.China and Vietnam should work closely on international and regional issues, Xi continued, noting that the remarkable development achievements of the two countries are the result of both the hard work of both sides and an open and inclusive world, especially a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific.China does not engage in exclusive cliques, block politics or camp confrontation, Xi said, adding that China is ready to strengthen multilateral cooperation with Vietnam, and work with Vietnam to uphold genuine multilateralism, and jointly increase the voice and influence of developing countries in international affairs.Xi also called on the two countries to manage differences on maritime issues.The two sides should actively discuss and carry out more maritime cooperation projects, strive to promote joint maritime development, and turn challenges posed by maritime issues into opportunities of bilateral cooperation, he added.On behalf of the Vietnamese party, state and people, Trong warmly welcomed Xi's state visit to Vietnam on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam-China comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and once again extended sincere congratulations on the major theoretical and practical innovation

(Xinhua/Wang Shen)During talks with the Nauruan president, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific island nation Nauru on Monday signed up for the Belt and Road Initiative in the presence of its president, David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China on March 24-29, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.It is Adeang's first China trip since the two countries restored diplomatic ties earlier this year.During talks with the Nauruan leader, Xi pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.As the two presidents are charting the course for further growth of bilateral ties, a Chinese-aided solar power project being built with the participation of nearly 100 Nauruan workers has already begun to make a difference to local communities, a living testament to the fast-growing win-win cooperation between the two countries.A man works at the construction site of redevelopment project of Aiwo Harbor in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)FROM BLUEPRINT TO REALITYNauru, with its beautiful tropical scenery and brilliant sunshine, is endearingly dubbed as a "pearl of the Pacific." In the southwestern part of the island nation, rows of blue photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged close to the azure sea, reflecting the dazzling tropical sunlight.Once connected to the grid, the photovoltaic power generation and energy storage project being constructed by a Chinese company can meet the electricity demand of the entire island.The project will reduce Nauru's dependence on diesel, bringing down the costs in electricity generation, improving local power supply and increase the share of renewable energy generation. Most importantly, it will significantly add to Nauru's environmental protection efforts, thereby achieving its sustainable development goals."Now Nauru's power generation mainly relies on diesel. That's expensive and would pollute the environment," said John Scott, who has been working for the project since 2022."There is a lot of sunshine here and it's good for solar power. I believe electricity supply here will be much better when the project is completed," Scott told Xinhua.On top of building the power project, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is also undertaking the redevelopment of Nauru's largest harbor, Aiwo Harbor.Starting in 2019, the project to be completed in 2025 includes harbor dredging and the construction of a new wharf, a desalination system and a container yard, among other facilities. And in September 2022, the new wharf was put into operation.The modern seaport has also brought cutting-edge technologies and job opportunities to the island country, facilitating local economic growth by expanding its connectivity with the rest of the world.Zhu Wei, the contractor's deputy manager and construction manager of the project, has witnessed the development of Aiwo Harbor over the past five years."In the past, the old wharf was too small for container ships to dock directly, and they only came once every two months. Now the containers can dock directly at the new wharf, and they come every month or even every 20 days," Zhu told Xinhua.As the facilities are gradually taking shape, Zhu is proud of his efforts over the past years. "I'm looking forward to seeing the projects I have personally participated in contribute more to the economic development of Nauru."The rationale behind Nauru's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China "of course is about Nauru's development strategy," Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's foreign minister, said when visiting China in January."No developing country wants to be left behind," he said.This photo taken on Jan. 20, 2024 shows a coastal view of the Republic of Nauru. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)"GRASS OF HAPPINESS"Being a Pacific island nation, Nauru is struggling to cope with such pressing challenges as rising sea levels and land erosion brought about by climate change. Worse still, the meager resources of fresh water for daily life is a persistent concern for local residents.Due to its unfavorable natural conditions for cultivation, Nauru heavily relies on imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits, resulting in high prices in the market, said Joanna Olsson, director of the Government Information Office of Nauru.Juncao, a hybrid grass developed by Chinese scientists as a major multi-functional agricultural resource, offers a feasible resolution to these woes. Translated literally as mushroom grass, Juncao can be used for mushroom farming, or as livestock forage and poultry feed, and a green barrier to forestall desertification.When working in east China's Fujian Province more than two decades ago, Xi Jinping introduced the Juncao technology to a visiting provincial governor from Papua New Guinea, another island nation in the Pacific, marking the beginning of international cooperation on Juncao technology.Having taken root in over 100 countries and regions around the globe, Juncao has been hailed by the locals as the "Chinese grass" or "grass of happiness."Last month, Hess-Tekai Foilape, an agricultural extension officer for Nauru's Department of Environment, Management and Agriculture, became the first person from Nauru to attend a Juncao technology training course held by Chinese scientists in Fiji."I believe that adopting Juncao technology in Nauru would be highly beneficial for our country. Potential impacts include improved food security, increased resilience to climate change, and enhanced economic opportunities through the development of new industries," Foilape told Xinhua.People use fishing nets to catch seafood in the sea in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)GROWING TOGETHERBoth developing countries, China and Nauru face the common tasks of growing the economy, improving people's wellbeing and realizing modernization.China has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its own deeds, Foreign Minister Aingimea said.Recalling his visit to a waste-to-energy plant and an electric vehicle factory in China, he said what impressed him most was "how advanced it is.""The technology blew my mind, absolutely amazing," he said, depicting China's path towards modernization as "fast and visionary."The Belt and Road Initiative brings development opportunities to Pacific island nations, said Olsson, who is optimistic about future cooperation between the two nations, particularly on climate change, water supply and agriculture.In his meeting with Adeang, Xi said China is ready to provide assistance to Nauru for its independent and sustainable development without political strings attached.Friendship, old or new, will have a bright future as long as it is started. Cooperation, whatever its size, will be productive as long as it is sincere, Xi said.■     This undated photo shows the Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. (Ethiopian Space Science and Geospatial Institute/Handout via Xinhua)Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.Ethiopia, as one of the growing list of countries cooperating with China under the BRI, has witnessed the initiative's significant contribution in terms of meaningfully transforming the lives of millions of Ethiopians, said Melaku Mulualem, a senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Foreign Affairs."The BRI has improved the lives of many Ethiopians. Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations. Through this global initiative, many Ethiopians have got job opportunities," he said.Photo taken on Feb. 29, 2024 shows the sorting machine at the e-commerce logistics hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)Citing a well-known Chinese saying that goes "If you want to get rich, you must first build roads," Mulualem said completed large-scale Chinese-built infrastructure projects are currently advancing Ethiopia's domestic and regional integration. He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI. He said the success of these projects vividly illustrates the multifaceted benefits of jointly building high-quality BRI projects.Recent data from the Ethiopian government also support his assertion. Since the Chinese-built Ethiopia-Djibouti railway's official commercial operation in January 2018, the railway had operated 1,824 passenger trains with nearly 530,900 passengers, and 6,133 cargo trains with about 7,328,500 tonnes of cargo as of June 2023.The railway, often regarded as Africa's first modern cross-border electrified railway, also witnessed its total operating revenue maintaining an average annual growth rate of more than 35 percent.The cooperation with China under the BRI is also propelling Africa's second-most populous country's aspiration of becoming a manufacturing hub and a lower-middle income economy shortly through the large-scale development of industrial parks across the country. Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people. Training and skill transfer are very important to make Ethiopians even more capable to handle and run completed projects. These will make the implementation of BRI projects much more sustainable," he said.  ■  Chinese Premier Li Qiang meets with Nauruan President David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Li Yahui)Statistics show that in the past decade since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative, more than 400 higher vocational colleges in China and foreign educational institutions have forged cooperation in running schools, with Luban Workshop established in over 20 countries.Many vocational education programs from China have also been introduced in the Belt and Road participating countries, cultivating high-quality professional employees.In 2017, the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, a Belt and Road flagship project jointly built by China Road and Bridge Corporation and the Kenya government, officially opened to traffic. Two vocational colleges from Liaoning sent their staff to Kenya and helped Kenya train over 300 railway talents."Recently, we've signed two new international joint education programs, mainly serving the construction of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and China-Mongolia railway. Compared with previous programs, we are paying more attention to the employment and technical needs of the enterprises this time," said Dong Yanan, vice president of Liaoning Railway Vocational and Technical College.At present, China has the world's largest vocational education system. According to data released by the Ministry of Education in 2023, there are 9,752 secondary vocational schools in the country, with over 17.8 million students. In 2022, there were 1,521 higher vocational schools with an enrollment of 5.46 million students. These institutions annually produce approximately 10 million high-quality technical personnel.OVERSEAS PROGRAMS"Many believe that only students with good academic performance from famous universities have the opportunity to study abroad. Now, we can also study abroad through our own efforts and excellent vocational skills, which is a great encouragement to me," said Chen Xingwang, one of the six students from the School of Economics and Management at Guangzhou Nanyang Polytechnic College who studied in the Republic of Korea last year.In order to better serve the development of Chinese enterprises overseas, 18 vocational colleges in south China's Guangdong Province have launched 39 overseas education programs.Students attend a vocational program run by BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

(BBA), located in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning, has run a vocational program. Collaborating with vocational schools, BBA develops industry-relevant courses that align with the needs of both the schools and the enterprise. This initiative aims to offer students more comprehensive practical training and on-the-job internship opportunities.Currently, two vocational colleges and BBA are jointly building a program. Every year, the company selects some students who will go from vocational colleges and training centers to on-the-job internships, and can get employed after they pass the examinations."Thanks to the program, I immediately got a job after graduation," said Sun Haoran, 22, a maintenance worker at the company's production line. "Last year, I spent eight weeks in Munich on the BMW Group's global apprenticeship exchange program. I was exposed to advanced equipment and acquired a deeper understanding of equipment maintenance," Sun added.A cooperation signing ceremony of "Mozi workshop" is held during the Belt and Road International Conference on Reform and Development of Vocational Education in Shenyang, northeast China's Liaoning Province, Sept. 27, 2023.

(Xinhua/Wang Shen)During talks with the Nauruan president, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific island nation Nauru on Monday signed up for the Belt and Road Initiative in the presence of its president, David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China on March 24-29, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.It is Adeang's first China trip since the two countries restored diplomatic ties earlier this year.During talks with the Nauruan leader, Xi pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.As the two presidents are charting the course for further growth of bilateral ties, a Chinese-aided solar power project being built with the participation of nearly 100 Nauruan workers has already begun to make a difference to local communities, a living testament to the fast-growing win-win cooperation between the two countries.A man works at the construction site of redevelopment project of Aiwo Harbor in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)FROM BLUEPRINT TO REALITYNauru, with its beautiful tropical scenery and brilliant sunshine, is endearingly dubbed as a "pearl of the Pacific." In the southwestern part of the island nation, rows of blue photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged close to the azure sea, reflecting the dazzling tropical sunlight.Once connected to the grid, the photovoltaic power generation and energy storage project being constructed by a Chinese company can meet the electricity demand of the entire island.The project will reduce Nauru's dependence on diesel, bringing down the costs in electricity generation, improving local power supply and increase the share of renewable energy generation. Most importantly, it will significantly add to Nauru's environmental protection efforts, thereby achieving its sustainable development goals."Now Nauru's power generation mainly relies on diesel. That's expensive and would pollute the environment," said John Scott, who has been working for the project since 2022."There is a lot of sunshine here and it's good for solar power. I believe electricity supply here will be much better when the project is completed," Scott told Xinhua.On top of building the power project, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is also undertaking the redevelopment of Nauru's largest harbor, Aiwo Harbor.Starting in 2019, the project to be completed in 2025 includes harbor dredging and the construction of a new wharf, a desalination system and a container yard, among other facilities. And in September 2022, the new wharf was put into operation.The modern seaport has also brought cutting-edge technologies and job opportunities to the island country, facilitating local economic growth by expanding its connectivity with the rest of the world.Zhu Wei, the contractor's deputy manager and construction manager of the project, has witnessed the development of Aiwo Harbor over the past five years."In the past, the old wharf was too small for container ships to dock directly, and they only came once every two months. Now the containers can dock directly at the new wharf, and they come every month or even every 20 days," Zhu told Xinhua.As the facilities are gradually taking shape, Zhu is proud of his efforts over the past years. "I'm looking forward to seeing the projects I have personally participated in contribute more to the economic development of Nauru."The rationale behind Nauru's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China "of course is about Nauru's development strategy," Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's foreign minister, said when visiting China in January."No developing country wants to be left behind," he said.This photo taken on Jan. 20, 2024 shows a coastal view of the Republic of Nauru. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)"GRASS OF HAPPINESS"Being a Pacific island nation, Nauru is struggling to cope with such pressing challenges as rising sea levels and land erosion brought about by climate change. Worse still, the meager resources of fresh water for daily life is a persistent concern for local residents.Due to its unfavorable natural conditions for cultivation, Nauru heavily relies on imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits, resulting in high prices in the market, said Joanna Olsson, director of the Government Information Office of Nauru.Juncao, a hybrid grass developed by Chinese scientists as a major multi-functional agricultural resource, offers a feasible resolution to these woes. Translated literally as mushroom grass, Juncao can be used for mushroom farming, or as livestock forage and poultry feed, and a green barrier to forestall desertification.When working in east China's Fujian Province more than two decades ago, Xi Jinping introduced the Juncao technology to a visiting provincial governor from Papua New Guinea, another island nation in the Pacific, marking the beginning of international cooperation on Juncao technology.Having taken root in over 100 countries and regions around the globe, Juncao has been hailed by the locals as the "Chinese grass" or "grass of happiness."Last month, Hess-Tekai Foilape, an agricultural extension officer for Nauru's Department of Environment, Management and Agriculture, became the first person from Nauru to attend a Juncao technology training course held by Chinese scientists in Fiji."I believe that adopting Juncao technology in Nauru would be highly beneficial for our country. Potential impacts include improved food security, increased resilience to climate change, and enhanced economic opportunities through the development of new industries," Foilape told Xinhua.People use fishing nets to catch seafood in the sea in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)GROWING TOGETHERBoth developing countries, China and Nauru face the common tasks of growing the economy, improving people's wellbeing and realizing modernization.China has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its own deeds, Foreign Minister Aingimea said.Recalling his visit to a waste-to-energy plant and an electric vehicle factory in China, he said what impressed him most was "how advanced it is.""The technology blew my mind, absolutely amazing," he said, depicting China's path towards modernization as "fast and visionary."The Belt and Road Initiative brings development opportunities to Pacific island nations, said Olsson, who is optimistic about future cooperation between the two nations, particularly on climate change, water supply and agriculture.In his meeting with Adeang, Xi said China is ready to provide assistance to Nauru for its independent and sustainable development without political strings attached.Friendship, old or new, will have a bright future as long as it is started. Cooperation, whatever its size, will be productive as long as it is sincere, Xi said.■     This undated photo shows the Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. (Ethiopian Space Science and Geospatial Institute/Handout via Xinhua)Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.Ethiopia, as one of the growing list of countries cooperating with China under the BRI, has witnessed the initiative's significant contribution in terms of meaningfully transforming the lives of millions of Ethiopians, said Melaku Mulualem, a senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Foreign Affairs."The BRI has improved the lives of many Ethiopians. Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations. Through this global initiative, many Ethiopians have got job opportunities," he said.Photo taken on Feb. 29, 2024 shows the sorting machine at the e-commerce logistics hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)Citing a well-known Chinese saying that goes "If you want to get rich, you must first build roads," Mulualem said completed large-scale Chinese-built infrastructure projects are currently advancing Ethiopia's domestic and regional integration. He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI. He said the success of these projects vividly illustrates the multifaceted benefits of jointly building high-quality BRI projects.Recent data from the Ethiopian government also support his assertion. Since the Chinese-built Ethiopia-Djibouti railway's official commercial operation in January 2018, the railway had operated 1,824 passenger trains with nearly 530,900 passengers, and 6,133 cargo trains with about 7,328,500 tonnes of cargo as of June 2023.The railway, often regarded as Africa's first modern cross-border electrified railway, also witnessed its total operating revenue maintaining an average annual growth rate of more than 35 percent.The cooperation with China under the BRI is also propelling Africa's second-most populous country's aspiration of becoming a manufacturing hub and a lower-middle income economy shortly through the large-scale development of industrial parks across the country. Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people. Training and skill transfer are very important to make Ethiopians even more capable to handle and run completed projects. These will make the implementation of BRI projects much more sustainable," he said.  ■  Chinese Premier Li Qiang meets with Nauruan President David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 26, 2024.

Two vocational colleges from Liaoning sent their staff to Kenya and helped Kenya train over 300 railway talents."Recently, we've signed two new international joint education programs, mainly serving the construction of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and China-Mongolia railway. Compared with previous programs, we are paying more attention to the employment and technical needs of the enterprises this time," said Dong Yanan, vice president of Liaoning Railway Vocational and Technical College.At present, China has the world's largest vocational education system. According to data released by the Ministry of Education in 2023, there are 9,752 secondary vocational schools in the country, with over 17.8 million students. In 2022, there were 1,521 higher vocational schools with an enrollment of 5.46 million students. These institutions annually produce approximately 10 million high-quality technical personnel.OVERSEAS PROGRAMS"Many believe that only students with good academic performance from famous universities have the opportunity to study abroad. Now, we can also study abroad through our own efforts and excellent vocational skills, which is a great encouragement to me," said Chen Xingwang, one of the six students from the School of Economics and Management at Guangzhou Nanyang Polytechnic College who studied in the Republic of Korea last year.In order to better serve the development of Chinese enterprises overseas, 18 vocational colleges in south China's Guangdong Province have launched 39 overseas education programs.Students attend a vocational program run by BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

"We have a full agenda for FTA negotiations this year," he said.TOWARD A BROADER FTA NETWORKAs negotiations for Version 3.0 of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area are scheduled for this week in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Wang has vowed to exert efforts to conclude the talks this year.The building of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area was completed in 2010. According to customs data, trade between China and ASEAN since 2013 has logged an annual growth rate of 8.8 percent. In 2023, ASEAN was China's largest trading partner for the fourth straight year, while China held its position as ASEAN's largest partner for several years.Visitors shop at the pavilion for Vietnamese commodities at Nanning International Convention and Exhibition Center in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Sept. 18, 2023.

Advancements will be made in negotiations or upgrades of FTAs with the Gulf Cooperation Council, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland, according to the vice minister.Peruvian craftsman Oswaldo Mamani promotes alpaca toys at a booth of Warmpaca at the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) in east China's Shanghai, Nov. 7, 2023. (Xinhua/Wang Xiang)On a broader scale, Wang Shouwen noted that China will continue its efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).In an attempt to align with the CPTPP rules, China has introduced related documents and formulated reform measures to enhance institutional opening-up in Shanghai and other eligible regions. "If the practices yield good outcomes, we will replicate them in other regions of China," Wang Shouwen said.TOWARD HIGH-STANDARD OPENNESSIn the past year, China committed to a negative-list model of services and investment opening-up by signing an FTA with Nicaragua and reaching a protocol to further upgrade the FTA with Singapore.This marked a historic moment in China's FTA negotiation history, indicating that the country has reached a new level in advancing its FTA network toward high standards, according to Wang Shouwen.Commenting on the FTA upgrade protocol with Singapore, Yuan Bo, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said services and investment are where the growth potentials of the two countries' future development reside. "These two fields are the common interests of China and Singapore."Regarding RCEP cooperation, Yuan believes there is ample room for China to collaborate with RCEP members on consumer goods trade, cross-border e-commerce, service trade and investment, among other spheres.China's foreign trade value with 14 RCEP members amounted to 12.6 trillion yuan (about 1.77 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023, a 5.3 percent increase compared with that in 2021 before the agreement came into force, according to Wang Shouwen.People visit the booth of South Korea during the 2023 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at China National Convention Center in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 4, 2023.

In recent years, it has been extensively used in various foods and beverages in China, such as cakes, coffee, and hot pot, especially after the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement.   The RCEP, which entered into force on Jan. 1, 2022, comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries, including 10 ASEAN member states and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand.   Two years on, many Thai industries in agriculture, textiles, and automobiles have benefited from the RCEP. Tariff cuts have further stimulated trade and investment growth of RCEP member countries. In 2022, Thailand's trade with other RCEP members rose 7.11 percent year on year to 300 billion U.S. dollars.   The agreement has also boosted trade cooperation between China and Thailand. According to Han Zhiqiang, Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, in the first 10 months of 2023, bilateral trade between the two countries reached 105.1 billion dollars. China continued to be Thailand's largest trading partner for 11th consecutive year and its largest agricultural export market, of which tropical fruits alone reached 5.8 billion dollars, accounting for 90 percent of Thailand's fruit exports.   Han said that Thai durian has transformed from a niche fruit to a "top stream" product in the Chinese market. Chinese consumers favor Thai fruits, and the Chinese government supports Thai agricultural exports to China.   "As a fruit importer, the RCEP agreement brings real benefits to me. The growing popularity of Thai coconuts in China is also bringing me new opportunities," said Mo Jiaming, a fruit dealer in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.   Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the RCEP, more diversified trade and transportation modes have been adopted, and more Thai goods have entered the Chinese market at favorable prices.   The transport of fresh Thai durians from Thailand to southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on the flagship BRI project, the China-Laos Railway, takes only four days. This is a vast improvement compared to the previous land-sea routes, which took eight to 10 days.   "Goods which could only be previously purchased during a trip to Thailand are now available in local supermarkets with a rich variety," said Huang Ying, a Nanning citizen, adding that she has many Thai products at home ranging from rice and seasonings, to latex pillows and mattresses, and daily beauty and sun protection products.   The RCEP agreement has also enhanced the industrial chains of China and Thailand, bringing new opportunities to enterprises.   Construction machinery made by Guangxi Mesda Group Co., Ltd. has entered the markets of ASEAN countries like Thailand in recent years, and has been warmly welcomed by local customers.   Huang Kanghua, chairman of the company, said that ASEAN countries have a great demand for China's advanced technology and products. "We are full of confidence in the ASEAN market," Huang said.   In the first nine months of 2023, Chinese enterprises applied for 264 investment projects in Thailand, up 196.6 percent year on year, with a total investment value of 97.46 billion baht (about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars), up 116.5 percent year on year. China will continue to maintain its position as the largest source country of foreign investment in Thailand.   Kirida Bhaopichitr, director for the Economic Intelligence Service of the Thailand Development Research Institute, said that Chinese investments drive the growth of industries such as electric vehicles in Thailand.  ■     A local driver is pictured beside a train of the Lagos Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) Blue Line in Lagos, Nigeria, March 2, 2024.

This trade corridor, jointly built by provincial-level regions in western China and ASEAN members, saw its cargo volume rise 21 percent year on year in 2023. Chongqing, which is the corridor's operational hub, became even more open to the world thanks to the corridor's greater impact last year.   China-Europe freight train services handled by Chongqing and the city of Chengdu, in the neighboring Sichuan Province, cover 110 cities in Europe and Asia. A total of 33 international flight routes involving Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport were resumed last year, said the city's mayor Hu Henghua when delivering the government work report.   Chongqing has continued to optimize its foreign investment and trade mix. In 2023, exports of the city's "new three" products, namely electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar cells, doubled compared with the previous year. The value of the city's automobile exports registered 51.9 percent year-on-year growth in 2023.

HONG KONG, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- In early December, landlocked Laos took a quantum leap toward the nation's dream of becoming a land-linked hub thanks to the inauguration of the China-Laos Railway.
Laos is the only nation in Southeast Asia without direct access to the sea. Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith called the occasion "a proud moment and the dream of all ethnic groups of Laos."
The first electrified railway in Laos was made possible by the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China's grand plan for a better-connected world was also behind Vietnam's first metro line, which went into commercial operation in capital Hanoi in November.
The Asia-Pacific is home to an extending infrastructure network which was further energized over the past year by new bridges, dams, highways, power lines and railroads, among other BRI projects. Even the COVID-19 pandemic did not slow down work for long. The East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia had almost its entire staff fully vaccinated by October.
Around the world, 141 countries and 32 international organizations, including 19 UN agencies, have participated in the BRI.
CHINESE TECHNICAL STANDARDS
In Bangladesh, the awe-inspiring Padma Bridge nears completion. The rail-road bridge is expected to speed up development and poverty reduction in the southwest of the riverine country, and to complete a key link in the envisaged trans-Asian rail network.
The Padma Bridge has 40 piers sunk into the sandy riverbed. According to Bangladeshi project engineer Dewan Muhammad Abdul Kader, "Every pier and span presented numerous challenges" to the Chinese engineers.
The China-Laos Railway has 75 tunnels in the 422-km Laos section. There -- and in Belt and Road projects elsewhere -- advanced technology and techniques are making short work of geological complexities.
Chinese management and technical standards are extensively applied. VR systems providing a virtual workplace for safety training help protect Malaysian workers, while state-of-the-art equipment like China's tunneling machines boosts progress in building the railway in eastern Malaysia.
Phase-II of the Karakoram Highway was declared one of the best projects in the world this year by U.S. weekly Engineering News-Record in September. Part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the highway is just one of 46 corridor projects underway or completed. Pakistan sees the corridor as a gamechanger for its national development.
CLEAN AND GREEN
No more coal-fired power plants will be built as part of the BRI, and a large number of hydropower projects are completed, underway or in the pipeline.
Notably, the Sirindhorn Dam in northeastern Thailand combines a floating solar farm with an existing hydropower plant. The Thai government plans to reproduce this model in 15 other locations as part of its climate commitment to a green low-carbon growth.
All Belt and Road projects are constructed in an environment-friendly manner, with a strong imperative to protect the local ecosystem. Construction of the railway created some 110,000 jobs in Laos, but the route remains just as verdant and lush as before the earthmovers arrived.
"After construction, revegetation goes. This is not just high-quality engineering, but also common sense. We want to leave the trackside in the condition we found it," said chief engineer Huang Daiwen. Huang's team has even applied for a patent for "roadbed slope revegetation devices" developed during their work in Laos.
Building hydro dams, of course, takes into account habitat protection for terrestrial wildlife. In the water, dams on the Nam Ou River in Laos have been restocked with native species of fish. Over 2 million fry have been released into the river over past years. And that's not just good for the health of the biosphere, it's good for local people too. Fish restaurants have sprung up, attracting customers from Luang Prabang, dozens of kilometers away. Songkham Yathika, 55, likes boasting about his personal journey from mountain man to fisherman to restaurateur.
LIVELIHOODS AND RISING HOPES
Thanks to the resumed BRI arrangement of chartered freight, in November the flow of pine nuts from Afghanistan to China got moving again, much to the relief of rural people whose only income comes from the nut. The whole pine-nut industrial chain provides at least 40,000 jobs in Khost and Paktia provinces. This trade is a lifeline in Afghanistan amid what might otherwise be a harsh winter of food shortages, economic crises and COVID-19.
To Sri Lankans, the BRI will bring more things than clean water to 450,000 Katana residents and a new outpatient building in commercial capital Colombo.
In September, a children's picture book, A City Rising from the Ocean was published. It tells the story of Colombo Port City, a financial hub growing on land reclaimed from the sea for the past seven years. Port City marina staged Colombo Fashion Week shows in November. A PwC study in November said that, once fully operational, the port city project will add 13.8 billion U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka's economy.
The China-funded 60,000-seat Morodok Techo National Stadium, built in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, was handed over to Cambodia in September. The country is now ready to host the Southeast Asian Games in 2023.
BROADER CONNECTIVITY
"The stadium serves as another bridge to connect the hearts of the two peoples," said Cambodian government's chief spokesperson Phay Siphan.
In inaugurating the eighth Cambodia-China Friendship Bridge in November, Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen thanked the BRI for benefiting the Cambodian people and thanked China for COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Those supplies have been instrumental in achieving the country's very high vaccination rates, with 13.56 million people or 84.8 percent of the population being fully vaccinated as of Dec. 15.
Cambodia is also setting up a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine filling factory. It is among the 29 countries in Asia-Pacific that began Belt and Road partnerships on COVID-19 vaccines cooperation and green development this June.
To return to the biggest BRI event of the year, the China-Laos Railway connecting Kunming in Southwest China to Lao capital Vientiane is a docking project between the BRI and Laos' development strategy.
According to President Thongloun, the shining green line of high tech through primal forest symbolizes the spirit of a community of a shared future and the shared dreams of peoples.

With global ambitions, many of them have embraced the tailwind produced by the BRI to expand their presence and navigate business landscapes across the world.With the trial run of Egypt's first electrified light rail line (LRT) last year, more than 180 escalators and elevators provided by American multinational Otis Worldwide Corporation for the project were put into operation.The LRT was one of the major BRI projects that saw participation from Otis in recent years. The multinational also supplied about 50 elevators and escalators for one of the tallest building in East Africa -- the new headquarters of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia inaugurated last year, among other projects."Over the years, Otis has been deeply involved in BRI projects," said Sally Loh, president of Otis China. The company has provided vertical transport solutions and dispatched technical teams to support elevator installation for many signature projects, she noted."By actively engaging in these projects, Otis has fully leveraged its advantages of being a global brand and manufacturing in China to support infrastructure construction and smart city development and contribute to regional prosperity," she said.As one of the world's major financial institutions, Deutsche Bank has borne witness to multinationals' participation in BRI projects."We see cases where multinationals co-develop renewable energy projects with Chinese players in the Middle East, and occasions where multinationals appear in the supply chain of BRI projects," said Peter Qiu, president of Deutsche Bank (China) Co., Ltd.Third-party market cooperation opportunities are appealing to multinational corporations, Qiu added.The German lender has been engaged in several BRI projects, including Sinosure's guaranteed syndication for China Harbor's infrastructure project in Jamaica and trade services for Chinese solar projects in Saudi Arabia.Having a global network of professional firms providing audit, tax and advisory services, KPMG has set up offices in more than 90 percent of BRI participating countries and regions, and will continue to scale up services for BRI-related investment and trade activities, said Jiang Liqin, head of clients and markets for KPMG China.Advancing the BRI will bring huge investment and development opportunities for local businesses cooperating with Chinese enterprises to improve their research, technology and application capabilities, Jiang added.Multinationals play an important role in facilitating infrastructure connectivity, smoothening trade and promoting financial integration under the BRI, which in turn provides huge business opportunities for them, said Liu Nanxing, an expert on international cooperation at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)."BRI cooperation has created enormous demand for products, investment and economic cooperation in various fields such as infrastructure construction," he noted. "It has offered multinationals new partnerships and supply orders, and increased needs for their services."Many multinational companies pay great attention to the BRI and make it one of the key factors to be considered in their global layout, in a bid to strengthen cooperation with various parties and broaden the space for development, he said.According to a white paper on BRI cooperation released by China's State Council Information Office, countries and businesses are encouraged to engage through various forms such as bilateral cooperation, third-party market cooperation and multilateral cooperation, thereby creating synergy for development.By joining third-party market cooperation, enterprises from different countries can work together to carry out projects, which can reduce the risk of undertaking projects on their own, especially given the large scale of some BRI projects, said Liu.The BRI is not only attractive to multinational giants, but also for foreign-funded small and medium-sized companies, which could enter overseas markets through the BRI to boost international development, Liu added.Since the BRI was proposed in 2013, over 3,000 cooperation projects have been launched, involving close to 1 trillion U.S. dollars of investment, creating an array of national landmarks, livelihood projects, and milestones of cooperation.The Chinese government has been clear that it is open to multinational companies taking part in BRI projects, and for those willing to engage, it offers some interesting opportunities since multinationals and Chinese firms have complementary contributions to make, said Carl F. Fey, Professor of Strategy at BI Norwegian Business School.He said multinationals can lend international experience to the projects as well as technology and strong brand names, while they can benefit from taking part in such projects by obtaining additional business, especially given the sluggish global economy.Multinationals are both a driving force and beneficiaries of globalization, which now faces challenges and calls for transformation, while BRI cooperation is a major contributor to the sound development of globalization, said Liu from the NDRC.Looking forward, he believes that the BRI, by connecting broad regions with economic vitality and potentials, will shape new growth centers for the world economy, help partner countries advance modernization, and propel global economic recovery."This process will generate even more opportunities for both partner countries and multinational companies," he said.  ■  This photo taken on July 31, 2023 shows the Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, Spain.The train service from the Chinese small commodity hub of Yiwu to the European commodity center of Madrid was officially launched in November 2014, spanning eight countries in Eurasia with a total length of more than 13,000 kilometers.The train service from Yiwu to Madrid has become a carrier of economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries along the railway and has built a new bridge for opening and cooperation between countries and peoples along the line.

Before arriving in Hamburg, it made stops at various ports, including Dalian, Shanghai, Ningbo, Singapore, Piraeus, and Rotterdam. Right now, it is heading back to Shanghai.The container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo calls at Meishan port area of Ningbo Zhoushan Port in east China's Zhejiang Province, Aug. 21, 2023. (Xinhua/Wei Yijun)In command of this colossal ship is Captain Mo Weidong, a seasoned mariner with over three decades of shipping experience. It is Mo's fifth year sailing on this specific route."Having sailed back and forth on the route between China and Europe, I have indeed witnessed the transformative effects of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)," the 54-year-old captain told Xinhua reporters, as the ship called at Ningbo Zhoushan Port.From the vantage point of the ship's bridge, perched dozens of meters above the deck, a bustling scene unfolds at the port. Containers are being impeccably stacked in precise rows by the gantry cranes used adeptly to handle them, ensuring an efficient and seamless workflow."Since the beginning of this year, we've seen a notable increase in cargo volumes on this shipping route," said Mo, while adding that there has been a surge in the exports of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.Captain Mo Weidong operates the radar at the bridge of the container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo on its way to Rotterdam Port, in the Mediterranean Sea, Sept. 15, 2023. (Xinhua)Mo also revealed that aircraft parts will now be shipped weekly from the Port of Hamburg to the Tianjin Port via this route, further attesting to the thriving trade and economic exchanges between China and Europe.At present, the Port of Hamburg is directly connected to major Chinese ports via 15 regularly scheduled liner services. Approximately one-third of the containers processed at the Port of Hamburg either originate from China or are bound for China.Jens Meier, CEO of Hamburg Port Authority, underscored the significance of cooperation between the Port of Hamburg and Chinese ports. "We are actively sharing knowledge and strengthening the corridors, particularly in maritime supply chains, as well as land-based corridors," Meier explained.A container ship of China's COSCO Shipping calls at the Port of Hamburg in Germany, Aug. 12, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Pengfei)In late August, the COSCO Shengshi, a ship used to carry vehicles, arrived at Germany's Port of Bremerhaven, where it unloaded 530 commercial vehicles from China, marking the successful maiden voyage of the liner.On its way to Bremerhaven, a total of 3,731 Chinese-made commercial vehicles, including over 2,700 new energy vehicles, were loaded onto the ship at the ports of Shanghai and Xiamen.Following its departure from Xiamen, the COSCO Shengshi navigated across the Indian Ocean and passed through the Suez Canal, making stops at ports in the UK and Belgium before finally reaching Germany. This 43-day journey spanned approximately 9,900 nautical miles.Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few years, the flow of trade between China and Europe has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Mo observed an increase in trade volume, noting that it now takes two days to unload at Piraeus Port in Greece, compared to one and a half days previously.This aerial photo taken on Feb. 19, 2022 shows a terminal of Piraeus Port in Greece. (Piraeus Container Terminal S.A./Handout via Xinhua)In 2022, China and the EU, who are each other's second-largest trading partners, achieved record bilateral trade flows of 847.3 billion U.S. dollars, marking a year-on-year increase of 2.4 percent. This equates to over 1.6 million U.S. dollars worth of trade conducted on average every minute. Simultaneously, the two-way cumulative stock of direct investment had exceeded 230 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2022.BRI cooperation has significantly enhanced maritime connectivity, fostering flourishing China-EU trade and economic partnership. COSCO Shipping, for instance, now operates 181 container liner routes and allocates over 50 percent of its container capacity to BRI partner countries. The company has also invested in 57 ports within these nations.In 2016, COSCO Shipping acquired a 67-percent stake in Piraeus Port and took over the port's management and operation. In May 2023, COSCO Shipping Ports, the company's ports operator, acquired a nearly 25 percent stake in one of Hamburg's terminals.With the investment from China, Piraeus Port has become a leading European port. Data from the port revealed that in the fiscal year of 2022, its profit after tax had stood at 52.9 million euros, achieving a remarkable 43.9 percent increase from the previous year.This photo taken on Aug. 21, 2023 shows containers loaded on the container ship Cosco Shipping Virgo at Meishan port area of Ningbo Zhoushan Port in east China's Zhejiang Province.

(Photo by Salim/Xinhua)Chinese enterprises have built 12 roads and 21 bridges in Bangladesh, with several transportation projects underway or to be implemented soon, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.by Sun NanDHAKA, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- It used to take Rukhsana Parveen Khan 30 to 45 minutes to reach Bonani from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. Today, the journey is a mere five minutes. "This is excellent," she told Xinhua. "I use this road daily and will benefit greatly from it."The road Khan mentioned is the First Dhaka Elevated Expressway, one of Bangladesh's flagship infrastructure projects, which opened partly to traffic on Sept. 3.Bangladesh's capital and largest city, Dhaka, has a population of nearly 20 million. However, the inadequate road infrastructure has made traffic congestion frequent. "We have to struggle with huge traffic jams every day, so it's terrible for us," said Khan.To solve this problem, the 19.73-km expressway project, with a total investment of 1.263 billion U.S. dollars, was launched on Jan. 1, 2020, under the guidance of the local government. China's Shandong Hi-Speed Group Company Ltd. is the project's leading investor and builder.However, advancing the project was not easy. According to Zheng Xiaozhong, director of Shandong Hi-Speed International Bangladesh Company Limited, a section of the road crosses a railway line with trains passing every 15 minutes on average, leaving almost no time for construction.To solve the issue, the contractor designed an "adjustable mobile door frame" using cast-in-place crossbeams. Thanks to the innovative construction technology, the project's first phase was officially open to traffic in September.Speaking at the expressway's opening, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called it "a new milestone in Bangladesh's city mass transport system," adding that it would play a significant role in developing communication between the capital and the rest of the country.Bangladesh is the first South Asian country to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since then, Bangladesh has made significant progress in Belt and Road cooperation with China, particularly in infrastructure construction.The Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, which passes through Bangladesh's largest Chinese-built Padma Bridge, is one of the most significant projects under construction by China Railway Group Limited and funded by the Export-Import Bank of China.The Bangladeshi government recently launched an experimental passenger train with Chinese-made coaches on a section of the newly constructed mega rail line.This is a "historic moment," Bangladeshi lawmaker Saifuzzaman Shikhar told Xinhua, adding, "I'm crossing the Padma Bridge by train. It was a matter of our past dreams. But it is a reality today."The first section of the railway link is about 80 km long and is expected to be launched in October. The entire 172-km project is scheduled for completion in 2024.It will serve as a vital channel connecting Dhaka and more than 20 districts in the country's south and is expected to greatly promote regional connectivity and economic development.Taking the train, Bangladeshi Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan expressed his hope that China will continue cooperating with Bangladesh.People attend The Belt and Road Initiative in Bangladesh Exhibition 2023 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Sept. 8, 2023. (Xinhua)As an old Chinese proverb goes, "It's better to teach a man how to fish than to give him fish." While improving road traffic, BRI projects in Bangladesh have trained many professionals, including designers and engineers.The runway extension project of Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar Airport, built by two Chinese companies, is Bangladesh's first maritime airport runway expansion project. It will upgrade the domestic airport into the country's fourth international airport upon completion.Project coordinator Musharraf Hussain said, "Working on such a significant project, I learned a lot of technical expertise and management experience that I had not encountered before.""It was a great experience for me and will be a key part of my career," he added.Hussain's story is an example of those inspired by the BRI. Chinese enterprises have shared their own development experience and achievements with their Bangladeshi counterparts to help the country tap its development potential.These projects mentioned above epitomize BRI cooperation between China and Bangladesh in transportation and cultivating talent in the South Asian country.Until now, Chinese enterprises have built 12 roads and 21 bridges in Bangladesh, with several transportation projects underway or to be implemented soon, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.Infrastructure, the bedrock of connectivity, is a priority area of Belt and Road cooperation. Prime Minister Hasina recently said that Belt and Road cooperation has opened a new development door for Bangladesh.■  Workers work on the seafood processing production line at Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. in Fuqing, southeast China's Fujian Province, Aug. 24, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhou Yi)FUZHOU, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- In a farm situated in the Pemalang district of Indonesia's Central Java province, prawn larvae have now reached the age of one and a half months. Once four months old, they will undergo processing and be shipped to Fuzhou, capital city of east China's Fujian Province, about 2,000 nautical miles away.Seasoned prawn farmer Joni Setyawan is in charge of the farm. The 66-year-old has nearly four decades of experience in raising Vannamei prawns. Since 2021, he has been working with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd., focusing on prawn cultivation.The farm in Pemalang district covers around 70,000 square meters. Prawns cultivated here undergo preliminary processing such as cleaning, peeling and frozen packaging at a local plant. Thereafter, vessels carrying these seafood products will embark on a journey of approximately 20 days before arriving at Fuzhou Port."The Vannamei prawns from Indonesia will go through further processing, such as mixing and pounding, and transformed into prawn paste and packaged for quick freezing," said Lin Zhengrong, general manager of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd.Known for its delectable and chewy texture, prawn paste is very popular in the Chinese catering market.Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. has also invested in Vannamei prawn farming in Indonesia, with their farm spanning a vast area of around 4 million square meters.The company established the farm in Indonesia because of the country's warm and humid climate, abundant fisheries resources, short cultivation cycle, and relatively low labor costs. Back in China, the advanced cold chain logistics infrastructure, vast consumer market and mature seafood processing technology can further enhance the value of imported frozen prawn products.Setting up fishery bases in Indonesia has not only increased local employment opportunities but also boosted the income of residents, said Chen Qing'an, the legal representative of the Indonesian subsidiary of Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd., noting that the subsidiary has employed more than 300 local workers."I had three prawn ponds, but now I oversee a total of 70 ponds of two farms. My monthly income has multiplied and is very stable," said Joni Setyawan, adding that he has supplied about 1,200 tonnes of Vannamei prawns to China over the past year and a half.Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd. and Fuqing Zhaohua Aquatic Food Co., Ltd. are among dozens of food companies operating in Fujian's Yuanhong Investment Zone. The zone represents the Chinese part of the "Two Countries, Twin Parks" project jointly undertaken with Indonesia. The Indonesian part involves the Bintan Industrial Estate, the Aviarna Industrial Estate and the Badung Industrial Estate.With the memorandum signed in January 2021, the "Two Countries, Twin Parks" project represents a solid step to synergize the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Indonesia's vision of the Global Maritime Fulcrum. It also serves as an innovative approach to deepening bilateral economic and trade ties, bringing tangible benefits to businesses in both countries.To date, the Chinese park has launched 27 investment projects with a total investment of 55.4 billion yuan (about 7.57 billion U.S. dollars) and 18 trade projects."The 'Two Countries, Twin Parks' project has benefited enterprises inside the industrial parks, offering more streamlined customs clearance services, saving us a significant amount of time," Lin said. ■Workers work on the seafood processing production line at Fujian MiaoTianHui Food Co., Ltd. in Fuqing, southeast China's Fujian Province, Aug. 24, 2023.

Ethiopia, as a gateway to Africa, stands as a pioneer in China-Africa cooperation, serving as a vital connecting hub on the continent and a steadfast partner of China in promoting collaboration through common platforms," he said.Ganga pointed out the tangible benefits of BRI infrastructure and connectivity projects in Ethiopia, particularly citing the Ethiopia-Djibouti standard gauge railway line, which has significantly improved Ethiopia's import-export channels.He said the BRI played an important role in catalyzing Ethiopia's development aspirations by supporting the establishment of industrial parks and laying the groundwork for the growth of manufacturing industries in the East African country."In the realm of people-to-people exchanges, a cornerstone of the BRI, China has been instrumental in supporting Ethiopia's educational and cultural development. Scholarships offered by the Chinese government underscore the depth of cooperation between our two nations," Ganga added.The symposium reflected on the achievements of the BRI over the past decade and discussed strategies for advancing a high-quality and more innovative BRI agenda in the future, aiming to foster practical and beneficial development towards a community of shared future between the two countries.Xu Jianping, director-general of the Department of Regional Opening-up at the National Development and Reform Commission of China, emphasized the results of cooperation with China under the BRI in Ethiopia. He reiterated China's commitment to implementing high-quality BRI cooperation as the initiative enters its second decade.Officials and scholars from Ethiopia and China attend a BRI-themed symposium in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on March 20, 2024.

They called for further enhancing high-quality BRI cooperation between China and Ethiopia as part of the BRI's second-decade implementation.The participants highlighted that the symposium presented an opportune moment to capitalize on the enduring ties between China and Ethiopia, especially following the elevation of their bilateral relations to an all-weather strategic partnership in October last year.  ■   This aerial photo taken on Sept. 20, 2023 shows a partial view of the Kenya Mombasa Oil Terminal, in Mombasa, Kenya.

We have seen what that cooperation has contributed in terms of infrastructure development," Namwamba noted.He cited significant projects, including the construction of the international sports stadium in Nairobi's Kasarani neighborhood, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway as examples of successful bilateral cooperation.Additionally, Namwamba emphasized that Kenyan youth can leverage China's advancements in the digital space, especially in artificial intelligence, to drive economic growth and self-reliance.Noting that China offers valuable lessons to Kenya and other African countries on inclusive growth, Namwamba said "there are definitely opportunities to expand areas of communication in sports, in creative industries, in music, in film, in theater, in so many areas where we can link our young people together."■  Malaysian artist Mohamad Rusli Bin Ahmad makes a kite during an intangible cultural heritage exhibition on the Maritime Silk Road in Quanzhou, southeast China's Fujian Province, Dec. 9, 2023.

It has pictures of a peacock, flowers and trees drawn in clear Chinese painting styles.The bottle is strikingly similar in design to a Chinese counterpart at the Ningxia Museum: a brown glazed ceramic vase with flower patterns dating to the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) and discovered in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region."The closeness of these ancient ceramics in Syria and Ningxia is one example of close exchanges between China and the West Asian region up to the Mediterranean in ancient times," said Wang Yi, head of the display department of the Ningxia Museum."Many relics unearthed here have also been proven to be imports from Persia, Iraq and Syria, and even the Eastern Roman Empire," said Wang.At a parallel exhibition of ancient Ningxia heritage at the museum, one can see a long-necked glass bottle and a glass hanging bottle, believed to have been imported from West Asia during the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907)."The earliest glass relic unearthed in Ningxia is a 6th-century glass plate from Persia," Wang said.A total of 97 pieces or sets of cultural relics from Syria, including stoneware, bronzeware and statues, are currently on display at the Ningxia Museum in Yinchuan, capital of Ningxia. Several cultural relics unearthed in Ningxia are also displayed to shed light on the cultural and trade exchanges between China and Syria in history."China and Syria enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges. This exhibition provides an important window through which visitors can appreciate the splendid history and civilization of Syria up close, and experience the exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations," said Tan Ping, director of Art Exhibitions China, which co-hosted the exhibition with the Ningxia regional government.Su Xiaomei, a local historian with the Guyuan Museum of Ningxia, whose relics are also on display at the Ningxia Museum, said, "This exhibition also offers a chance to hold dialogue on the role of the Silk Road in building over 2,000 years of exchanges between the people of China and Syria, which is more significant considering the Belt and Road Initiative of modern time." ■     Students attend a free class given by Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Educational and Cultural Exchange Base in the carriage of a running Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU train in Indonesia, Oct. 24, 2023. (Xinhua/Xu Qin)by Xinhua writers Xu Qin, Yu QianliangJAKARTA, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian teenagers feel the charm of "China Speed" and light up their dreams for the future.On Tuesday, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Educational and Cultural Exchange Base brought a free class to the Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School in West Bandung Regency, West Java Province.Chinese high-speed rail technical experts from China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) Sifang Co., Ltd., the company which designed and manufactured Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU trains, visited the school campus to give HSR science courses to local students, and led Indonesian teenagers to experience the immersive charm of "China Speed" on a running Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU train."Boys and girls, who can tell me why the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway trains can run so fast?" In the class, Zhang Fangtao, chief designer of Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU trains, got a new identity as a science teacher who lectured on the HSR science.In the classroom which is near to a traditional railway line and Jakarta-Bandung HSR's Padalarang Station, the curious students listened carefully to their science teacher and actively raised their hands to answer questions.The vibe in the 40 sq m classroom was lively with frequent interactions and Q&As between Zhang and students, punctuated by rounds of laughter and applause.Saskia, a 15-year-old 9th grader, said, "Cutting the journey between Jakarta and Bandung from more than three hours to about 40 minutes is just cool, I do think high-speed train is a good choice for many people."The classroom teaching was followed by an on-site experience inside the carriage of a running EMU train from Jakarta-Bandung HSR's Padalarang Station to Halim Station. The laughter of the teenagers and the shutter sound of their mobile phones filled the entire carriage of the fast moving train past fields, rivers, mountains, plains of Java Island.Zhang, once again, lectured on the HSR science, but this time the classroom was moving, on a real high-speed train, only to find that he had to grab the teenagers' attention from frequent exclamations and fleeting scenery outside the train window."After the commercial operation started last week, I finally had the opportunity to ride the high-speed train. During the free ride phase, my parents tried in vain to get a ticket for me," said Rayi, 14, another 9th grader. "I learned a lot about HSR today in the class and on the train, and I can't wait to be a business person in the future to travel by the high-speed train."Besides the lectures in and outside the classroom, CRRC Sifang has donated teaching materials including computers and sound systems to Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School.The school is a small public school having hundreds of students and only a few classrooms used by students of Grade 7-9 on a rotating basis."I am very grateful to these Chinese companies for supporting the development of education in West Bandung. CRRC Sifang donates teaching materials to our school, which can help us to improve the quality of education," said Mepi, head of the junior high school."The HSR lectures and experience helped broaden the students' horizons, opening the door to a new world for our kids."Asep Wahyu, West Bandung Regency's economy and development assistant, said, "It is really generous for CRRC Sifang to provide assistance to our local school. The teaching materials and the free class will help our students study better.""I heard that Chinese people would call their kids 'flowers of the country', and Indonesian people has a similar saying as calling our children 'buds of the country', be it flower or bud, they are the future, they are our hope," Asep added.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR is a "golden brand" of China-Indonesia cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by China. It is the first high-speed railway in Indonesia and Southeast Asia at large. CRRC Sifang, as a party of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR project, designs and manufactures high-speed EMU trains with a maximum operating speed of 350 km per hour for the railway."The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway is not only a symbol of win-win cooperation between China and Indonesia, but also a connecting bridge to enhance the friendship between our two nations," said Cao Rui, CRRC Sifang's deputy general manager.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR, jointly built by China and Indonesia, was officially put into commercial operation on Oct. 17.The Jakarta-Bandung HSR EMU Educational and Cultural Exchange Base was established in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia on Sept. 9. ■Students from Ngamprah No.3 Junior High School take photos and videos of a Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway (HSR) Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train on the platform of Padalarang Station in Padalarang, Indonesia, Oct. 24, 2023.

(Xinhua/Yang Guanyu)     Tourists taste local snacks at the ancient city of Tianshui in Qinzhou District of Tianshui City, northwest China's Gansu Province, March 20, 2024. (Xinhua/Ma Xiping)BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- After a nine-hour drive, Su Youchun arrived in Tianshui, Gansu Province, with a hunger fueled by anticipation for one of China's latest online culinary obsessions: Malatang, the numbing-spicy hotpot.The street snack, with various ingredients cooked in a chili oil-rich sauce, did not fail him. "The chili peppers in Tianshui's Malatang are delicious and not too overpowering. They have a unique flavor of their own," said Su.Su's judgment of Malatang should not be taken with a grain of salt, as the 47-year-old has worked in the catering industry for nearly 20 years. Moreover, he hails from Sichuan, a province synonymous with spice, most notably its own signature numbing-spicy hotpot.CHARM OF DELICACIESSichuan-style hotpot first graced Tianshui's dinner tables in the 1990s, and since then has taken on a life of its own, distinct from its forebearer thanks to its inclusion of local chili pepper strains."Our locally-grown chili peppers are the soul of the dish. Building on that, various recipes and innovations have flourished," said Ha Haiying, who runs a hotpot restaurant in Tianshui near an ancient temple in memorial to Confucius.Despite its rich history and culture, Tianshui has remained under the radar to many people, even in China, until the dish's recent online viral fame.According to statistics on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, the total views of content tagged with "Tianshui Malatang" and "Gansu Malatang" have exceeded 1.5 billion. So far, relevant content has received more than 85.79 million likes and 81.12 million comments from netizens.The online popularity of Tianshui's numbing-spicy hotpot soon kick-started an influx of tourists, hankering to taste the dish themselves. Many Malatang stalls and restaurants are packed with people, with long queues now becoming a common sight across the city.Hu Xiaoyu, who operates a Malatang eatery with her husband, is one of the local catering business owners riding the boom. According to her, the wooden sticks she uses to skewer vegetables and meat in the numbing-spicy hotpot can stack over a meter high after a day's business.CULTURE, TOURISM CONSUMPTIONThe Malatang business has also spurred cultural and tourism consumption in Tianshui. From March to date, the total ticket sales of the city's tourist attractions increased by 216.8 percent year on year."Life here is laid-back and cozy, and the weather is agreeable, with so much culture and history to explore," said Ju Yuexuan, a tourist from Liaoning Province in northeast China.As an amateur gourmet, Ju was drawn to Tianshui by the fame of its numbing-spicy hotpot. During her three-day trip, she not only chowed down on many local delicacies, but also visited the Maijishan Grottoes, ancient Tianshui town and a temple dedicated to the mythical Chinese ancestor Fuxi."It is such a pleasure for me to find so many cultural gems in a city like Tianshui during my quest for popular street food," Ju said.In China, Tianshui does not stand alone in translating the charm offensive of local delicacies on social media into a prosperous cultural and tourism market.Last year, the unique local barbecue of Zibo in Shandong Province, east China, featuring grilled meat wrapped in crispy pancakes with shallots, made a splash on Chinese social media.Zibo saw its hotel bookings increase over eight-fold during the May Day holiday in 2023 compared with the same period in 2019, with total orders in the tourism sector up 20-fold.This year, Zibo has continued to woo tourists with a series of events such as a recently-concluded folk culture festival that combined local snacks with cultural performances.On Chinese social media platforms such as lifestyle-sharing app Xiaohongshu, posts sharing food in smaller and less-known cities have gained rising discussions and interactions among foodies, offering potential opportunities for these cities to become the next foodie destination.According to the latest five-year work plan issued by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the country will invest further efforts to improve the quality of the catering industry for tourists, promote the combination of tourism, catering and cultural sectors, and develop cuisine-featured tourism.  ■  A farmer checks sensors at a greenhouse of a vegetable base in Aykol Town of Aksu, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, March 24, 2024.

Then, we traveled to Austria to upgrade both software and hardware for our existing clients, while we also discussed some new projects," said Bai Ming, vice general manager of Kocel.The situation was quite different for Kocel over a decade ago. Back then, the company invested heavily in importing 3D printing equipment from overseas to improve a challenging work environment and low productivity in the traditional casting industry. However, high operational costs hindered widespread use of such equipment, while technical issues had to be resolved by foreign experts.Facing such challenges, the company decided in 2015 to embark on the localization and industrialization of mold 3D printing technology. After overcoming hurdles related to printing materials, processes, software, equipment, and key technologies, Kocel successfully developed the first large-scale, high-efficiency industrial mold 3D printer in China."This successful development marked the domestic initiation of the industrial application of mold 3D printing," said Zhou Zhijun, R&D director of Kocel, who also noted that the company has since developed more than ten mold 3D printer models.In the company's mold 3D printing smart factory, traditional challenges such as the need for cranes, molds, physical effort and temperature variations have been solved effectively. Workers need to simply touch a button on a control screen for the production box of a 3D printer to automatically print the product based on the model designed in the computer."In traditional mode, it takes over a month for a new casting to evolve from blueprint to finished product. However, mold 3D printing technology is able to cut this process to a week, while also significantly improving the quality and precision of items produced," said Zhou.The transformation in the casting workshop is a tangible reflection of the new quality productive forces driving the transformation and upgrade of the traditional foundry industry. A total of seven intelligent foundries based on 3D printing technology have been established nationwide, which are able to achieve full digitalization of the casting production process and a production efficiency more than three times that of traditional foundries of the same scale."Our goal is to further reduce costs, improve efficiency, and make mold 3D printing equipment more accessible and affordable for more foundry enterprises. The R&D team will also continue exploring innovation in new areas such as ceramics, metals, graphite, and other printable materials," said Zhou. ■This photo taken with a mobile phone on Feb. 6, 2024 shows components of mold 3D printers to be delivered to clients in Kocel Intelligent Machinery Limited in Yinchuan, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Ren Wei)This photo taken with a mobile phone on Feb. 23, 2023 shows the products made by mold 3D printers of Kocel Intelligent Machinery Limited in Yinchuan, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Ren Wei)This photo taken with a mobile phone on Feb. 6, 2024 shows a worker adjusting a mold 3D printer at a workshop of Kocel Intelligent Machinery Limited in Yinchuan, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Ren Wei)     Members of the press work near the site where a bridge collapsed in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States, on March 26, 2024. Maryland officials said on Tuesday that two people have been rescued while six others are still unaccounted for following the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. (Xinhua/Hu Yousong)BALTIMORE, the United States, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Maryland officials said on Tuesday that two people have been rescued while six others are still unaccounted for following the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld told reporters at a news conference that eight people were on the bridge when it was struck by a cargo ship in the Patapsco River in the early hours of Tuesday.One of the two individuals saved from water is in the hospital and the other is fine. Rescue teams continue to search for missing people in the water."The preliminary investigation points to an accident," Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. "We haven't seen any credible evidence of a terrorist attack."The crew on the ship notified authorities they had lost power and issued a "mayday" call before it collided with the 2.6-kilometer-long, four-lane bridge, according to Moore.The White House said on Tuesday that U.S. President Joe Biden "has been briefed on the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the ongoing search and rescue efforts," adding that he "will continue to receive updates from his team throughout the day."Biden will address the incident later on Tuesday, according to reports.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that they "are closely monitoring the tragic situation unfolding.""There are no indications this was an intentional act and we are assessing the impacts to the Port of Baltimore," Mayorkas added.The U.S. Coast Guard said that it received a report saying a Singapore-flagged container vessel collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge at 1:27 a.m. (0527 GMT) on Tuesday, and that it is coordinating with local, state, and federal agencies in response to the incident.Kweisi Mfume, who represents Maryland's 7th congressional district that encompasses parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, wrote on X that "the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse is an unthinkable horror.""Our prayers right now are for the missing individuals and victims of this tragedy," Mfume said.Danish shipping giant Maersk said in a statement on Tuesday that the container ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge is "DALI", which is owned by Grace Ocean, and operated by Synergy Group."It is time chartered by Maersk and is carrying Maersk customers' cargo," the statement read. "No Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel.""Due to the damage to the bridge and resulting debris, it will not be possible to reach the Helen Delich Bentley port of Baltimore for the time being. In line with this, we are omitting Baltimore on all our services for the foreseeable future, until it is deemed safe for passage through this area," Maersk said.Synergy Group, based in Singapore, confirmed the safety of all crew members and pilots without any reported injuries or pollution. The cause of the incident remains under investigation.The Francis Scott Key Bridge, which opened to traffic in March 1977, carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. ■Photo taken on March 26, 2024 shows the collapsed bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States.

(Ethiopian Space Science and Geospatial Institute/Handout via Xinhua)Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has significantly contributed to the betterment of the lives of ordinary Ethiopians, Ethiopian experts have said.Ethiopia, as one of the growing list of countries cooperating with China under the BRI, has witnessed the initiative's significant contribution in terms of meaningfully transforming the lives of millions of Ethiopians, said Melaku Mulualem, a senior international relations and diplomacy researcher at Ethiopia's Institute of Foreign Affairs."The BRI has improved the lives of many Ethiopians. Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations. Through this global initiative, many Ethiopians have got job opportunities," he said.Photo taken on Feb. 29, 2024 shows the sorting machine at the e-commerce logistics hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)Citing a well-known Chinese saying that goes "If you want to get rich, you must first build roads," Mulualem said completed large-scale Chinese-built infrastructure projects are currently advancing Ethiopia's domestic and regional integration. He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI. He said the success of these projects vividly illustrates the multifaceted benefits of jointly building high-quality BRI projects.Recent data from the Ethiopian government also support his assertion. Since the Chinese-built Ethiopia-Djibouti railway's official commercial operation in January 2018, the railway had operated 1,824 passenger trains with nearly 530,900 passengers, and 6,133 cargo trains with about 7,328,500 tonnes of cargo as of June 2023.The railway, often regarded as Africa's first modern cross-border electrified railway, also witnessed its total operating revenue maintaining an average annual growth rate of more than 35 percent.The cooperation with China under the BRI is also propelling Africa's second-most populous country's aspiration of becoming a manufacturing hub and a lower-middle income economy shortly through the large-scale development of industrial parks across the country. Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people. Training and skill transfer are very important to make Ethiopians even more capable to handle and run completed projects. These will make the implementation of BRI projects much more sustainable," he said.  ■  Search and Rescue (SAR) team members search for victims after a landslide at Cibenda village in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Yang Guanyu)BOAO, Hainan, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Asia remains a dynamic and attractive destination for global investment, said attendees at a sideline forum of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), which convenes its 2024 annual conference in Boao, a resort town in southern China's Hainan Province.According to the forum's Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress flagship report, Asian economies demonstrated strong resilience in investment activities in 2022. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into Asia-Pacific economies amounted to 809.4 billion U.S. dollars, growing by 6.76 percent over the previous year and accounting for 62 percent of international FDI inflows.Asia has been a significant beneficiary of FDI, said Shamshad Akhtar, Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs of Pakistan, while noting the role of FDI in Asia's development at the sub-forum with a theme of "Investing the Future of Asia."It is important to recognize that Asia, particularly emerging markets, is now on its own development momentum. Asia have become the world's manufacturing and trade hub supported by foreign capital and investments, she noted.In 2022, Asian economies attracted a total of 8.8 trillion U.S. dollars in portfolio investment, and China's stock of portfolio investment surpassed 1 trillion U.S. dollars for the first time, said the report.Speaking at the forum, Charles Dallara, a member of the Board of Directors of Partners Group, said foreign investments are supporting the global market developments and Asia is really a dynamic and attractive location for investments, especially FDI.Among Asian economies, China is a very attractive destination for FDI, he said, adding that at the same time, a large amount of capital from China has flowed to other countries and many Chinese businesses and enterprises are investing in the United States, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia.Officials and experts also voiced opinions on how to boost investor confidence, improve the investment environment, and enhance investment destinations' attractiveness in Asia.Geopolitical influence, rule of law, market potential, industrial system, labor forces, market players, and policy support are factors that affect the inflow of FDI, said Xu Zhibin, deputy administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.Governments also play an important role in attracting global capital, said Shimizu Tokiko, assistant governor of the Bank of Japan, adding that Asian countries have resilient economy and governments should have consistent policy arrangements and provide a clear map on its own development for investors.According to the report, the Asian economy is expected to grow by around 4.5 percent in 2024, surpassing that of 2023, and continue to be the largest contributor to global economic growth.With a founding purpose to promote economic integration in Asia, the mission of the BFA is to pool positive energy for the development of Asia and the world.

(Xinhua/Han Xu)The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released by the African Union and the United Nations migration agency.ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released Tuesday by the African Union (AU) and the United Nations migration agency.The second edition of the Africa Migration Report, jointly launched by the AU and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, noted that migration in Africa remains a complex phenomenon, with multiple drivers shaping people's decisions about movement within and outside the continent.According to the report, one key characteristic of African migration is that the majority of international migrants engage in intra-African migration. It noted that African countries have more emigrants than immigrants, with a level of international migration lower than the global average.Data from the report showed that about 25.1 million people, accounting for about 1.9 percent of the 1.3 billion people who live in Africa, live outside the countries where they were born, which remained below the global corresponding share of 3.6 percent as of 2020."African migrants do migrate outside the continent, although at a slightly lower extent than within Africa, while limited immigration to Africa from abroad occurs," the report said.This photo, taken on Feb. 18, 2024, shows the twilight scenery at Friendship Square in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Li Yahui)Meanwhile, the report underscored that migration plays a major role in the development of African countries of origin as migrants continue to maintain strong relationships with relatives back in their countries and communities of origin, eventually contributing to development there.It noted that migrants' role in development comes in the form of remittances, as well as through the sharing of knowledge and ideas between receiving and origin countries.The report also highlighted that while the African continent is home to some of the most promising developments in regional cooperation and collaboration, the continent is also home to some of the most intricate contemporary patterns of human mobility.Noting the crucial need for policymakers to have a clear sense of the nature of the challenges associated with human mobility, the report underscored the need to "fully understand and manage mobility in ways that are just, inclusive and that place the welfare of the African people front and center."  ■  The official stamps for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games are seen during a presentation at the French Postal Museum in Paris, France, March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Wang Shen)During talks with the Nauruan president, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific island nation Nauru on Monday signed up for the Belt and Road Initiative in the presence of its president, David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China on March 24-29, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.It is Adeang's first China trip since the two countries restored diplomatic ties earlier this year.During talks with the Nauruan leader, Xi pledged that the Chinese side is ready to work with the island nation to expand cooperation in economy and trade, climate change, as well as in infrastructure, among other sectors.As the two presidents are charting the course for further growth of bilateral ties, a Chinese-aided solar power project being built with the participation of nearly 100 Nauruan workers has already begun to make a difference to local communities, a living testament to the fast-growing win-win cooperation between the two countries.A man works at the construction site of redevelopment project of Aiwo Harbor in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)FROM BLUEPRINT TO REALITYNauru, with its beautiful tropical scenery and brilliant sunshine, is endearingly dubbed as a "pearl of the Pacific." In the southwestern part of the island nation, rows of blue photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged close to the azure sea, reflecting the dazzling tropical sunlight.Once connected to the grid, the photovoltaic power generation and energy storage project being constructed by a Chinese company can meet the electricity demand of the entire island.The project will reduce Nauru's dependence on diesel, bringing down the costs in electricity generation, improving local power supply and increase the share of renewable energy generation. Most importantly, it will significantly add to Nauru's environmental protection efforts, thereby achieving its sustainable development goals."Now Nauru's power generation mainly relies on diesel. That's expensive and would pollute the environment," said John Scott, who has been working for the project since 2022."There is a lot of sunshine here and it's good for solar power. I believe electricity supply here will be much better when the project is completed," Scott told Xinhua.On top of building the power project, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is also undertaking the redevelopment of Nauru's largest harbor, Aiwo Harbor.Starting in 2019, the project to be completed in 2025 includes harbor dredging and the construction of a new wharf, a desalination system and a container yard, among other facilities. And in September 2022, the new wharf was put into operation.The modern seaport has also brought cutting-edge technologies and job opportunities to the island country, facilitating local economic growth by expanding its connectivity with the rest of the world.Zhu Wei, the contractor's deputy manager and construction manager of the project, has witnessed the development of Aiwo Harbor over the past five years."In the past, the old wharf was too small for container ships to dock directly, and they only came once every two months. Now the containers can dock directly at the new wharf, and they come every month or even every 20 days," Zhu told Xinhua.As the facilities are gradually taking shape, Zhu is proud of his efforts over the past years. "I'm looking forward to seeing the projects I have personally participated in contribute more to the economic development of Nauru."The rationale behind Nauru's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China "of course is about Nauru's development strategy," Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's foreign minister, said when visiting China in January."No developing country wants to be left behind," he said.This photo taken on Jan. 20, 2024 shows a coastal view of the Republic of Nauru. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)"GRASS OF HAPPINESS"Being a Pacific island nation, Nauru is struggling to cope with such pressing challenges as rising sea levels and land erosion brought about by climate change. Worse still, the meager resources of fresh water for daily life is a persistent concern for local residents.Due to its unfavorable natural conditions for cultivation, Nauru heavily relies on imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits, resulting in high prices in the market, said Joanna Olsson, director of the Government Information Office of Nauru.Juncao, a hybrid grass developed by Chinese scientists as a major multi-functional agricultural resource, offers a feasible resolution to these woes. Translated literally as mushroom grass, Juncao can be used for mushroom farming, or as livestock forage and poultry feed, and a green barrier to forestall desertification.When working in east China's Fujian Province more than two decades ago, Xi Jinping introduced the Juncao technology to a visiting provincial governor from Papua New Guinea, another island nation in the Pacific, marking the beginning of international cooperation on Juncao technology.Having taken root in over 100 countries and regions around the globe, Juncao has been hailed by the locals as the "Chinese grass" or "grass of happiness."Last month, Hess-Tekai Foilape, an agricultural extension officer for Nauru's Department of Environment, Management and Agriculture, became the first person from Nauru to attend a Juncao technology training course held by Chinese scientists in Fiji."I believe that adopting Juncao technology in Nauru would be highly beneficial for our country. Potential impacts include improved food security, increased resilience to climate change, and enhanced economic opportunities through the development of new industries," Foilape told Xinhua.People use fishing nets to catch seafood in the sea in the Republic of Nauru, Jan. 18, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)GROWING TOGETHERBoth developing countries, China and Nauru face the common tasks of growing the economy, improving people's wellbeing and realizing modernization.China has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its own deeds, Foreign Minister Aingimea said.Recalling his visit to a waste-to-energy plant and an electric vehicle factory in China, he said what impressed him most was "how advanced it is.""The technology blew my mind, absolutely amazing," he said, depicting China's path towards modernization as "fast and visionary."The Belt and Road Initiative brings development opportunities to Pacific island nations, said Olsson, who is optimistic about future cooperation between the two nations, particularly on climate change, water supply and agriculture.In his meeting with Adeang, Xi said China is ready to provide assistance to Nauru for its independent and sustainable development without political strings attached.Friendship, old or new, will have a bright future as long as it is started. Cooperation, whatever its size, will be productive as long as it is sincere, Xi said.■     This undated photo shows the Chinese-built ground station at the Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia.

Chinese-built industry parks are currently playing an important role in attracting international investors to the East African country.Recalling his years of experience in China, Asnake Getie Asmare, an Ethiopian alumnus from China's Beijing Normal University and currently engaged in large-scale telecommunication infrastructure development initiatives in Ethiopia, argued that the BRI is serving as a platform for Ethiopia and other BRI member countries to benefit from China's vast developmental advancements.Asmare said the BRI cooperation has been "greatly supporting Ethiopia's economic growth through infrastructure development, such as roads, railways, industrial parks, power and telecom sector, among others."He said the BRI cooperation with China has facilitated Ethiopia's integration and connectivity with its neighboring countries while augmenting employment and education opportunities for the country's burgeoning youth population, much-needed transfer of technology and knowledge, and cultural exchanges.Since its inception in 2013, the BRI, which covers an extensive range of development sectors, has won plaudits from experts and policymakers, who are calling for further strengthening the cooperation as the initiative embarks on its second-decade implementation."I expect that cooperation between China and Ethiopia under the BRI will advance in mutual development, people-to-people relationship, and cooperation in global issues of mutual interest," Asmare said.In addition to further expanding their mutually beneficial cooperation approach in large-scale investments and infrastructure development endeavors, Asmare said the two friendly countries also need to expand their BRI cooperation across various areas that have already seen commendable outcomes, such as education, health, cultural exchange, and growing diplomatic relations.Mulualem also underscored the need to further augment cooperation in boosting people-to-people relations as well as knowledge and skills transfer as the mainstay of cementing the wider Sino-Ethiopian cooperation under the BRI."In order to make the BRI cooperation even more fruitful, I believe there is a need to work more on the relationship of the Ethiopian and Chinese people. Training and skill transfer are very important to make Ethiopians even more capable to handle and run completed projects. These will make the implementation of BRI projects much more sustainable," he said.  ■  Chinese Premier Li Qiang meets with Nauruan President David Adeang, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Li Yahui)Statistics show that in the past decade since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative, more than 400 higher vocational colleges in China and foreign educational institutions have forged cooperation in running schools, with Luban Workshop established in over 20 countries.Many vocational education programs from China have also been introduced in the Belt and Road participating countries, cultivating high-quality professional employees.In 2017, the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, a Belt and Road flagship project jointly built by China Road and Bridge Corporation and the Kenya government, officially opened to traffic. Two vocational colleges from Liaoning sent their staff to Kenya and helped Kenya train over 300 railway talents."Recently, we've signed two new international joint education programs, mainly serving the construction of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and China-Mongolia railway. Compared with previous programs, we are paying more attention to the employment and technical needs of the enterprises this time," said Dong Yanan, vice president of Liaoning Railway Vocational and Technical College.At present, China has the world's largest vocational education system. According to data released by the Ministry of Education in 2023, there are 9,752 secondary vocational schools in the country, with over 17.8 million students. In 2022, there were 1,521 higher vocational schools with an enrollment of 5.46 million students. These institutions annually produce approximately 10 million high-quality technical personnel.OVERSEAS PROGRAMS"Many believe that only students with good academic performance from famous universities have the opportunity to study abroad. Now, we can also study abroad through our own efforts and excellent vocational skills, which is a great encouragement to me," said Chen Xingwang, one of the six students from the School of Economics and Management at Guangzhou Nanyang Polytechnic College who studied in the Republic of Korea last year.In order to better serve the development of Chinese enterprises overseas, 18 vocational colleges in south China's Guangdong Province have launched 39 overseas education programs.Students attend a vocational program run by BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

"We have a full agenda for FTA negotiations this year," he said.TOWARD A BROADER FTA NETWORKAs negotiations for Version 3.0 of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area are scheduled for this week in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Wang has vowed to exert efforts to conclude the talks this year.The building of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area was completed in 2010. According to customs data, trade between China and ASEAN since 2013 has logged an annual growth rate of 8.8 percent. In 2023, ASEAN was China's largest trading partner for the fourth straight year, while China held its position as ASEAN's largest partner for several years.Visitors shop at the pavilion for Vietnamese commodities at Nanning International Convention and Exhibition Center in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Sept. 18, 2023. (Xinhua/Zhou Hua)The two parties announced the official launch of the negotiations to upgrade the free trade area to its third version in November 2022, with the negotiations covering fields such as trade in goods, investment, digital and green economy to build a more inclusive, modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial China-ASEAN FTA.Experts believe that the upcoming version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area would also prompt the upgrade of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).It will be easier for the RCEP to leverage its coordinating and superimposing effects, following the leading example of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area Version 3.0, said Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University of China.Apart from ASEAN, China also aims to complete the FTA negotiations with Honduras, and the negotiations involving the FTA upgrade with Peru this year. Advancements will be made in negotiations or upgrades of FTAs with the Gulf Cooperation Council, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland, according to the vice minister.Peruvian craftsman Oswaldo Mamani promotes alpaca toys at a booth of Warmpaca at the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) in east China's Shanghai, Nov. 7, 2023. (Xinhua/Wang Xiang)On a broader scale, Wang Shouwen noted that China will continue its efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).In an attempt to align with the CPTPP rules, China has introduced related documents and formulated reform measures to enhance institutional opening-up in Shanghai and other eligible regions. "If the practices yield good outcomes, we will replicate them in other regions of China," Wang Shouwen said.TOWARD HIGH-STANDARD OPENNESSIn the past year, China committed to a negative-list model of services and investment opening-up by signing an FTA with Nicaragua and reaching a protocol to further upgrade the FTA with Singapore.This marked a historic moment in China's FTA negotiation history, indicating that the country has reached a new level in advancing its FTA network toward high standards, according to Wang Shouwen.Commenting on the FTA upgrade protocol with Singapore, Yuan Bo, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said services and investment are where the growth potentials of the two countries' future development reside. "These two fields are the common interests of China and Singapore."Regarding RCEP cooperation, Yuan believes there is ample room for China to collaborate with RCEP members on consumer goods trade, cross-border e-commerce, service trade and investment, among other spheres.China's foreign trade value with 14 RCEP members amounted to 12.6 trillion yuan (about 1.77 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2023, a 5.3 percent increase compared with that in 2021 before the agreement came into force, according to Wang Shouwen.People visit the booth of South Korea during the 2023 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at China National Convention Center in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 4, 2023. (Xinhua/Ren Chao)The pact has allowed Chinese trade companies to enjoy 2.36 billion yuan of tariff concessions for products imported from RCEP countries, while enterprises of RCEP countries benefited from 4.05 billion yuan of tax breaks for products imported from China in 2023."China is both a beneficiary of and a significant contributor to the enforcement of RCEP," Yuan said.Looking into this year, to further develop China's FTA network into a high-standard one, the country will continue to increase the proportion of zero-tariff products, push forward the comprehensive opening-up of service trade and investment with market-access negative lists, and include trade rules concerning digital economy, green economy, standard certification and government purchase into new FTA negotiations, Wang Shouwen said.  Enditem(Video reporters: Wu Changwei; Video editors: Zhang Yueyuan, Hui Peipei, Zheng Xin, Zhang Nan)■     NANNING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's coconut, famous for its rich and sweet taste, has gained significant popularity in the Chinese market. In recent years, it has been extensively used in various foods and beverages in China, such as cakes, coffee, and hot pot, especially after the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement.   The RCEP, which entered into force on Jan. 1, 2022, comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries, including 10 ASEAN member states and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand.   Two years on, many Thai industries in agriculture, textiles, and automobiles have benefited from the RCEP. Tariff cuts have further stimulated trade and investment growth of RCEP member countries. In 2022, Thailand's trade with other RCEP members rose 7.11 percent year on year to 300 billion U.S. dollars.   The agreement has also boosted trade cooperation between China and Thailand. According to Han Zhiqiang, Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, in the first 10 months of 2023, bilateral trade between the two countries reached 105.1 billion dollars. China continued to be Thailand's largest trading partner for 11th consecutive year and its largest agricultural export market, of which tropical fruits alone reached 5.8 billion dollars, accounting for 90 percent of Thailand's fruit exports.   Han said that Thai durian has transformed from a niche fruit to a "top stream" product in the Chinese market. Chinese consumers favor Thai fruits, and the Chinese government supports Thai agricultural exports to China.   "As a fruit importer, the RCEP agreement brings real benefits to me. The growing popularity of Thai coconuts in China is also bringing me new opportunities," said Mo Jiaming, a fruit dealer in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.   Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the RCEP, more diversified trade and transportation modes have been adopted, and more Thai goods have entered the Chinese market at favorable prices.   The transport of fresh Thai durians from Thailand to southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on the flagship BRI project, the China-Laos Railway, takes only four days. This is a vast improvement compared to the previous land-sea routes, which took eight to 10 days.   "Goods which could only be previously purchased during a trip to Thailand are now available in local supermarkets with a rich variety," said Huang Ying, a Nanning citizen, adding that she has many Thai products at home ranging from rice and seasonings, to latex pillows and mattresses, and daily beauty and sun protection products.   The RCEP agreement has also enhanced the industrial chains of China and Thailand, bringing new opportunities to enterprises.   Construction machinery made by Guangxi Mesda Group Co., Ltd. has entered the markets of ASEAN countries like Thailand in recent years, and has been warmly welcomed by local customers.   Huang Kanghua, chairman of the company, said that ASEAN countries have a great demand for China's advanced technology and products. "We are full of confidence in the ASEAN market," Huang said.   In the first nine months of 2023, Chinese enterprises applied for 264 investment projects in Thailand, up 196.6 percent year on year, with a total investment value of 97.46 billion baht (about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars), up 116.5 percent year on year. China will continue to maintain its position as the largest source country of foreign investment in Thailand.   Kirida Bhaopichitr, director for the Economic Intelligence Service of the Thailand Development Research Institute, said that Chinese investments drive the growth of industries such as electric vehicles in Thailand.  ■     Members of the press work near the site where a bridge collapsed in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States, on March 26, 2024.

(Xinhua/Hu Yousong)BALTIMORE, the United States, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Maryland officials said on Tuesday that two people have been rescued while six others are still unaccounted for following the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld told reporters at a news conference that eight people were on the bridge when it was struck by a cargo ship in the Patapsco River in the early hours of Tuesday.One of the two individuals saved from water is in the hospital and the other is fine. Rescue teams continue to search for missing people in the water."The preliminary investigation points to an accident," Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. "We haven't seen any credible evidence of a terrorist attack."The crew on the ship notified authorities they had lost power and issued a "mayday" call before it collided with the 2.6-kilometer-long, four-lane bridge, according to Moore.The White House said on Tuesday that U.S. President Joe Biden "has been briefed on the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the ongoing search and rescue efforts," adding that he "will continue to receive updates from his team throughout the day."Biden will address the incident later on Tuesday, according to reports.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that they "are closely monitoring the tragic situation unfolding.""There are no indications this was an intentional act and we are assessing the impacts to the Port of Baltimore," Mayorkas added.The U.S. Coast Guard said that it received a report saying a Singapore-flagged container vessel collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge at 1:27 a.m. (0527 GMT) on Tuesday, and that it is coordinating with local, state, and federal agencies in response to the incident.Kweisi Mfume, who represents Maryland's 7th congressional district that encompasses parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, wrote on X that "the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse is an unthinkable horror.""Our prayers right now are for the missing individuals and victims of this tragedy," Mfume said.Danish shipping giant Maersk said in a statement on Tuesday that the container ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge is "DALI", which is owned by Grace Ocean, and operated by Synergy Group."It is time chartered by Maersk and is carrying Maersk customers' cargo," the statement read. "No Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel.""Due to the damage to the bridge and resulting debris, it will not be possible to reach the Helen Delich Bentley port of Baltimore for the time being. In line with this, we are omitting Baltimore on all our services for the foreseeable future, until it is deemed safe for passage through this area," Maersk said.Synergy Group, based in Singapore, confirmed the safety of all crew members and pilots without any reported injuries or pollution. The cause of the incident remains under investigation.The Francis Scott Key Bridge, which opened to traffic in March 1977, carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. ■Photo taken on March 26, 2024 shows the collapsed bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States.

Many Ethiopians are working on various BRI projects, including industrial parks, railway stations, highway and expressway constructions, digital networking sectors, and many others. These projects are also hugely contributing to our economy," said Mulualem.Mulualem said cooperation with China in implementing the BRI over the past decade has contributed to the realization of various infrastructure projects in Ethiopia while injecting a much-needed impetus to the development of the manufacturing sector, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and the creation of abundant job opportunities for Ethiopian youth."The BRI is a matter of interconnectedness through infrastructure development and people-to-people relations. Through this global initiative, many Ethiopians have got job opportunities," he said.Photo taken on Feb. 29, 2024 shows the sorting machine at the e-commerce logistics hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)Citing a well-known Chinese saying that goes "If you want to get rich, you must first build roads," Mulualem said completed large-scale Chinese-built infrastructure projects are currently advancing Ethiopia's domestic and regional integration. He declared these infrastructure projects have "facilitated fast transport for ordinary Ethiopians, businesspeople, as well as importers and exporters through ports in Djibouti."He singled out the 752.7-km Ethiopia-Djibouti railway, the construction of a dozen industrial parks in different regions of Ethiopia, as well as abundant scholarship opportunities benefiting thousands of Ethiopian students as part of the wider knowledge and skill transfer endeavor under the BRI.

(Xinhua/Yang Guanyu)BOAO, Hainan, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Asia remains a dynamic and attractive destination for global investment, said attendees at a sideline forum of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), which convenes its 2024 annual conference in Boao, a resort town in southern China's Hainan Province.According to the forum's Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress flagship report, Asian economies demonstrated strong resilience in investment activities in 2022. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into Asia-Pacific economies amounted to 809.4 billion U.S. dollars, growing by 6.76 percent over the previous year and accounting for 62 percent of international FDI inflows.Asia has been a significant beneficiary of FDI, said Shamshad Akhtar, Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs of Pakistan, while noting the role of FDI in Asia's development at the sub-forum with a theme of "Investing the Future of Asia."It is important to recognize that Asia, particularly emerging markets, is now on its own development momentum. Asia have become the world's manufacturing and trade hub supported by foreign capital and investments, she noted.In 2022, Asian economies attracted a total of 8.8 trillion U.S. dollars in portfolio investment, and China's stock of portfolio investment surpassed 1 trillion U.S. dollars for the first time, said the report.Speaking at the forum, Charles Dallara, a member of the Board of Directors of Partners Group, said foreign investments are supporting the global market developments and Asia is really a dynamic and attractive location for investments, especially FDI.Among Asian economies, China is a very attractive destination for FDI, he said, adding that at the same time, a large amount of capital from China has flowed to other countries and many Chinese businesses and enterprises are investing in the United States, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia.Officials and experts also voiced opinions on how to boost investor confidence, improve the investment environment, and enhance investment destinations' attractiveness in Asia.Geopolitical influence, rule of law, market potential, industrial system, labor forces, market players, and policy support are factors that affect the inflow of FDI, said Xu Zhibin, deputy administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.Governments also play an important role in attracting global capital, said Shimizu Tokiko, assistant governor of the Bank of Japan, adding that Asian countries have resilient economy and governments should have consistent policy arrangements and provide a clear map on its own development for investors.According to the report, the Asian economy is expected to grow by around 4.5 percent in 2024, surpassing that of 2023, and continue to be the largest contributor to global economic growth.With a founding purpose to promote economic integration in Asia, the mission of the BFA is to pool positive energy for the development of Asia and the world.

(Xinhua/Han Xu)The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released by the African Union and the United Nations migration agency.ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Africa's international migrants move primarily within the continent, according to a new report jointly released Tuesday by the African Union (AU) and the United Nations migration agency.The second edition of the Africa Migration Report, jointly launched by the AU and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, noted that migration in Africa remains a complex phenomenon, with multiple drivers shaping people's decisions about movement within and outside the continent.According to the report, one key characteristic of African migration is that the majority of international migrants engage in intra-African migration. It noted that African countries have more emigrants than immigrants, with a level of international migration lower than the global average.Data from the report showed that about 25.1 million people, accounting for about 1.9 percent of the 1.3 billion people who live in Africa, live outside the countries where they were born, which remained below the global corresponding share of 3.6 percent as of 2020."African migrants do migrate outside the continent, although at a slightly lower extent than within Africa, while limited immigration to Africa from abroad occurs," the report said.This photo, taken on Feb. 18, 2024, shows the twilight scenery at Friendship Square in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (Xinhua/Li Yahui)Meanwhile, the report underscored that migration plays a major role in the development of African countries of origin as migrants continue to maintain strong relationships with relatives back in their countries and communities of origin, eventually contributing to development there.It noted that migrants' role in development comes in the form of remittances, as well as through the sharing of knowledge and ideas between receiving and origin countries.The report also highlighted that while the African continent is home to some of the most promising developments in regional cooperation and collaboration, the continent is also home to some of the most intricate contemporary patterns of human mobility.Noting the crucial need for policymakers to have a clear sense of the nature of the challenges associated with human mobility, the report underscored the need to "fully understand and manage mobility in ways that are just, inclusive and that place the welfare of the African people front and center."  ■
