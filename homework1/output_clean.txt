from percent in to percent in with a projected rise to percent by this positive trend follows a notable decline in forest cover which plummeted from percent of the countrys landmass in to around percent in despite these achievements uganda faces a pressing challenge in meeting its national and global commitments to protect and restore forests largely due to the high rate of deforestation the country has lost about hectares of forests annually since without intervention uganda risks losing all its forests by driven largely by the growing human populationto address these challenges uganda pledged during the climate change summit to restore million hectares of degraded land by the country also launched a campaign to plant million trees annually focusing on indigenous species these efforts underscore ugandas commitment to sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservationthe east african country with contributions from private individuals the state and development partners has undertaken a variety of initiatives leveraging technology to enhance forest conservationzainabu kakungulu program officer for capacity development at the food and agriculture organization of the united nations highlighted the increasing importance of technology in forest management and conservation she emphasized that technology enables researchers and conservationists to better understand forest dynamics and protect them more effectively in uganda geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies such as drones are utilized for surveying and mapping

embracing bioscience charles bukuwa director of bukuwa nurseries smc ltd a private tree nursery operator employs biotechnology to produce fastgrowing droughtresistant and pestresistant treesif we are harvesting more and planting less it means we need a technology that is going to give us stock or trees that are going to grow faster to bridge this gap tree biotechnology is the way forward bukuwa explainedoperating in three different parts of the country bukuwas nurseries produce between to eucalyptus tree seedlings per two seasons annuallywith growing awareness among the public about the increasing demand for timber and the dwindling supply due to the cutting of natural forests many individuals are now engaging in tree planting as a business venturebukuwa believes that with this

meeting the increasing demand for tree seedlingsaccording to the national forest authority an average of about hectares of planted forests have been established annually over the last yearsas part of its efforts in forest conservation uganda has intensified its cooperation with china in forest conservation in recent yearsboth kakungulu and bukuwa highlighted that alongside the campaigns launched by the central government at the national level chinese citizens are encouraged to adopt or nurture trees donate money and engage in volunteer work related to treeskakungulu emphasized the need for ugandans to adopt a culture of caring for trees to ensure forest conservationthe national forestry and grassland administration of china reported significant achievements in afforestation in with the country planting about million hectares of trees and grassbukuwa noted that chinese children are taught about the importance of trees from a young age suggesting that education about tree conservation and the environment should be included in ugandas school syllabus for lower learning levels similar to chinas approachchina has imparted valuable lessons some of the technology originated from china

xinhuali he beijing feb xinhua chinas strides in space technology are now enriching the preservation of cultural relics as spacecraft engineers have repurposed a robot originally designed for orbital missions to protect tomb artifactsthe china academy of space technology cast recently announced the development of such a robot combined with electron beam irradiation technology it can be used as an intelligent mobile system to eradicate bacteria that thrive on ancient murals in small tombsequipped with a robotic arm mounted on a mobile wheeled chassis this device can scan scenes of tomb walls and domessimilar to the radiation disinfection technology used in medical treatment the electron beams can eliminate harmful bacteria that cause murals to fade or chip over timethe project was initiated by the dunhuang academy an institute for the protection and research of the world cultural heritage of dunhuang grottoes in china it has accumulated rich experience in cave painting conservation over the past decades from to the academy has taken the lead in onsite protection of national tomb muralsthe tomb mural preservation poses a great challenge said yu zongren head of the academys conservation institutebeing buried deep underground for extended periods exposes tomb murals to highly humid environments fostering the proliferation of microorganisms that accelerate their deterioration furthermore given the generally confined space within tombs any negligence in cleaning and protection work can result in additional damage to these invaluable relicsundated photo provided by the shanxi provincial institute of archaeology shows murals in a tomb chamber in luzhou district of changzhi city north chinas shanxi province xinhuathe conventional disinfection approach involves the use of chemical agents which unfortunately may pose health risks to the people involved as well as affect the muralsas immovable cultural relics murals need onsite protection so using traditional biocide agents is not a sustainable option yu notedin response to the demand for onsite protection of tomb murals researchers from the institute of high energy physics ihep under the chinese academy of sciences have undertaken the development of an intelligent mobile irradiation sterilization device they proposed the requirement of maintaining a small and precise size while prioritizing safety and collaborated with engineers from the cast to develop the robotdespite rich experience in developing robotic arms for large space capsules the engineers have never created a robot specifically for tomb artwork clearing beforewe had dedicated much of our efforts to reducing size and enhancing the flexibility of the robot making it more suitable for tomb applications said xu jianping head of the engineering teamlaser sensors installed on the remotely operated robot can detect and avoid obstacles ensuring a safe distance between the robot and the muralsaccording to xu these technologies had been used on chinas spacecraftalthough most of the engineers had never seen mural artworks before they take pride in using space technology for the protection of centuriesold cultural relics xu notedthe robot was showcased for the first time at a domestic exhibition on cultural relic protection last september the research team plans to conduct more experiments before

observatory has discovered a giant ultrahighenergy gammaray bubble structure about ten million times larger than our solar system in the cygnus starforming region around light years from earthbased on the observations made by chinas large high altitude air shower observatory lhaaso scientists identified that starforming region as one source of the cosmic rays in the milky way with an energy level higher than petaelectron volts quadrillion electron volts or pev about times more than the record high achieved by any manmade accelerator on earththis is the first super cosmic ray accelerator identified as of now with increasing observation time lhaaso is expected to detect more super cosmic ray accelerators and hopefully solve the mystery behind the origins of cosmic rays in the milky way said cao zhen principal investigator of lhaaso and an academician of chinese academy of sciences casthe discovery was published in the academic journal science bulletin on mondaycosmic rays are charged particles from outer space mainly composed of protons the origin of cosmic rays is one of the most important frontier issues in modern astrophysicsmeasurements of cosmic rays in past decades have revealed a break around pev in the energy spectrum which is called the knee of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its shape resembling a knee joint however the origin of cosmic rays in the knee region is still an unsolved mystery and one of the most intriguing topics in cosmic ray research in recent years said caolhaaso has discovered a giant ultrahighenergy gammaray bubble structure in the cygnus starforming region with multiple photons exceeding pev inside the structure with the highest energy reaching pev said yang ruizhi a key member of the research teamthat discovery indicates the presence of a super cosmic ray accelerator inside the bubble which continuously accelerates highenergy cosmic ray particles with energies of up to pev and injects them into interstellar space these highenergy cosmic rays collide with interstellar gas and produce gamma rays yang saidthe massive star cluster cygnus ob composed of many young hot massive stars near the center of the bubble is the most promising candidate for the super cosmic ray accelerator yang saidthe radiation luminosity of these stars is hundreds to millions of times that of the sun and the huge radiation pressure blows away the surface material of the stars forming dynamic stellar winds with speeds up to thousands of kilometers per second the collision of stellar winds with the surrounding interstellar medium and the violent collision between stellar winds have created ideal sites for efficient particle acceleration he explainedwe are looking forward to finding more similar cosmic ray sources through more observation to truly understand the mechanisms that can accelerate cosmic ray particles to such high energy and to solve the centurylong enigma of the origin of cosmic rays said caolhaaso located at an altitude of meters on mount haizi in daocheng county southwest chinas sichuan province is chinas national key scientific and technological infrastructure focusing on cosmic ray researchthe observatory which is the most sensitive ultrahighenergy gammaray detection device in the world was completed in july and began highquality and stable operation after that the facility is operated by the institute of high energy physics of cas with a universal international cooperation model to achieve open sharing of facility platforms and observational data currently domestic and foreign

francisco has borne witness to exchanges between the chinese and american peoples for over a century a hundred and fiftyeight years ago a large number of chinese workers came all the way to the united states to build the first transcontinental railroad and established in san francisco the oldest chinatown in the western hemisphere from here china and the united states have made many achievements usd billion of annual bilateral trade and over usd billion of twoway investment pairs of sister provincesstates and sister cities and over scheduled flights every week and over five million travels every year at peak time these extraordinary accomplishments were made jointly by our peoples accounting for nearly one quarter of the global population san francisco has also borne witness to the efforts by china and the united states in building a better world seventyeight years ago after jointly defeating fascism and militarism our two countries initiated together with others the san francisco conference which helped found the united nations and china was the first country to sign the un charter starting from san francisco the postwar international order was established over countries have gained independence one after another several billion people have eventually shaken off poverty the forces for world peace development and progress have grown stronger this has been the main fruit jointly achieved by people of all countries and the international community ladies and gentlemen friends the foundation of chinaus relations was laid by our peoples during world war ii our two countries fought side by side for peace and justice headed by general claire lee chennault a group of american volunteers known as the flying tigers went to the battlefield in china they not only engaged in direct combats fighting japanese aggressors but also created the hump airlift to transport muchneeded supplies to china more than chinese and american airmen lost their lives on this air route after japan attacked pearl harbor the united states sent b bombers on an air raid to japan in running low on fuel after completing their mission lieutenant colonel james doolittle and his fellow pilots parachuted in china they were rescued by chinese troops and local civilians but some civilian chinese were killed by japanese aggressors in retaliation the chinese people never forget the flying tigers we built a flying tigers museum in chongqing and invited over flying tigers veterans and their families to visit china i have kept in touch with some of them through letters most recently yearold harry moyer and yearold mel mcmullen both flying tigers veterans went back to china they visited the great wall and were warmly received by the chinese people the american people on their part always remember the chinese who risked their lives to save american pilots offspring of those american pilots often visit the doolittle raid memorial hall in quzhou of zhejiang province to pay tribute to the chinese people for their heroic and valorous efforts these stories fill me with firm confidence that the friendship between our two peoples which has stood the test of blood and fire will be passed on from generation to generation the door of chinaus relations was opened by our peoples for years there were estrangement and antagonism between our two countries but the trend of the times brought us together converging interests enabled us to rise above differences and the peoples longing broke the ice between the two countries in the us table tennis team visited beijing a small ball moved the globe not long after that mr mike mansfield led the first us congressional delegation to china this was followed by the first governors delegation including iowa governor robert ray and then many business delegations forming waves of friendly exchanges this year after the world emerged from the covid pandemic i have respectively met in beijing with dr henry kissinger mr bill gates senator chuck schumer and his senate colleagues and governor gavin newsom i told them that the hope of the chinaus relationship lies in the people its foundation is in our societies its future depends on the youth and its vitality comes from exchanges at subnational levels i welcome more us governors congressional members and people from all walks of life to visit china the stories of chinaus relations are written by our peoples during my first visit to the united states i stayed at the dvorchaks in iowa i still remember their address bonnie drive that was my first facetoface contact with the americans the days i spent with them are unforgettable for me they represent america i have found that although our two countries are different in history culture and social system and have embarked on different development paths our two peoples are both kind friendly hardworking and downtoearth we both love our countries our families and our lives and we both are friendly toward each other and are interested in each other it is the convergence of many streams of goodwill and friendship that has created a strong current surging across the vast pacific ocean it is the reaching out to each other by our peoples that has time and again brought chinaus relations from a low ebb back onto the right track i am convinced that once opened the door of chinaus relations cannot be shut again once started the cause of chinaus friendship cannot be derailed halfway the tree of our peoples friendship has grown tall and strong and it can surely withstand the assault of any wind or storm the future of chinaus relations will be created by our peoples the more difficulties there are the greater the need for us to forge a closer bond between our peoples and to open our hearts to each other and more people need to speak up for the relationship we should build more bridges and pave more roads for peopletopeople interactions we must not erect barriers or create a chilling effect today president biden and i reached important consensus our two countries will roll out more measures to facilitate travels and promote peopletopeople exchanges including increasing direct passenger flights holding a highlevel dialogue on tourism and streamlining visa application procedures we hope that our two peoples will make more visits contacts and exchanges and write new stories of friendship in the new era i also hope that california and san francisco will continue to take the lead on the journey of growing chinaus friendship ladies and gentlemen friends we are in an era of challenges and changes it is also an era of hope the world needs china and the united states to work together for a better future we the largest developing country and the largest developed country must handle our relations well in a world of changes and chaos it is ever more important for us to have the mind assume the vision shoulder the responsibility and play the role that come along with our status as major countries i have always had one question on my mind how to steer the giant ship of chinaus relations clear of hidden rocks and shoals navigate it through storms and waves without getting disoriented losing speed or even having a collision in this respect the number one question for us is are we adversaries or partners this is the fundamental and overarching issue the logic is quite simple if one sees the other side as a primary competitor the most consequential geopolitical challenge and a pacing threat it will only lead to misinformed policy making misguided actions and unwanted results china is ready to be a partner and friend of the united states the fundamental principles that we follow in handling chinaus relations are mutual respect peaceful coexistence and winwin cooperation just as mutual respect is a basic code of behavior for individuals it is fundamental for chinaus relations the united states is unique in its history culture and geographical position which have shaped its distinct development path and social system we fully respect all this the path of socialism with chinese characteristics has been found under the guidance of the theory of scientific socialism and is rooted in the tradition of the chinese civilization with an uninterrupted history of more than years we are proud of our choice just as you are proud of yours our paths are different but both are the choice by our peoples and both lead to the realization of the common values of humanity they should be both respected peaceful coexistence is a basic norm for international relations and is even more of a baseline that china and the united states should hold on to as two major countries it is wrong to view china which is committed to peaceful development as a threat and thus play a zerosum game against it china never bets against the united states and never interferes in its internal affairs china has no intention to challenge the united states or to unseat it instead we will be glad to see a confident open evergrowing and prosperous united states likewise the united states should not bet against china or interfere in chinas internal affairs it should instead welcome a peaceful stable and prosperous china winwin cooperation is the trend of the times and it is also an inherent property of chinaus relations china is pursuing highquality development and the united states is revitalizing its economy there is plenty of room for our cooperation and we are fully able to help each other succeed and achieve winwin outcomes the belt and road initiative as well as the global development initiative gdi the global security initiative gsi and the global civilization initiative gci proposed by china are open to all countries at all times including the united states china is also ready to participate in usproposed multilateral cooperation initiatives this morning president biden and i agreed to promote dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of mutual respect in areas including diplomacy economy and trade peopletopeople exchange education science and technology agriculture military law enforcement and artificial intelligence we agreed to make the cooperation list longer and the pie of cooperation bigger i would like to let you know that china sympathizes deeply with the american people especially the young for the sufferings that fentanyl has inflicted upon them president biden and i have agreed to set up a working group on counternarcotics to further our cooperation and help the united states tackle drug abuse i also wish to announce here that to increase exchanges between our peoples especially between the youth china is ready to invite young americans to china on exchange and study programs in the next five years recently the three pandas at smithsonians national zoo in washington dc have returned to china i was told that many american people especially children were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas and went to the zoo to see them off i also learned that the san diego zoo and the californians very much look forward to welcoming pandas back pandas have long been envoys of friendship between the chinese and american peoples we are ready to continue our cooperation with the united states on panda conservation and do our best to meet the wishes of the californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples ladies and gentlemen friends china is the largest developing country in the world the chinese people long for better jobs better lives and better education for their children it is what the billion chinese hold dear to their hearts the communist party of china cpc is committed to working for the people and our peoples expectation for a better life is our goal this means we must work hard to secure their support thanks to a century of exploration and struggle we have found the development path that suits us we are now advancing the rejuvenation of the chinese nation on all fronts by pursuing chinese modernization we are committed to striving in unity to achieve modernization for all chinese a large population is a fundamental aspect of chinas reality our achievements however great would be very small when divided by billion but a problem however small would be huge when multiplied by billion this is a unique challenge for a country of our size in the meantime big also means strength the leadership of the cpc the system of socialism with chinese characteristics and the endorsement and support of the people are our greatest strengths china is both a superlarge economy and a superlarge market not long ago the sixth china international import expo was held attracting over business exhibitors from countries including the united states the exhibition area of american companies has been the largest for six consecutive years at the expo modernization for billion chinese is a huge opportunity that china provides to the world we are committed to prosperity for all to deliver a better life for each and every chinese to eliminate poverty is the millenniaold dream of the chinese nation and prosperity for all is the longing of all chinese before i turned i was in a village in northern shaanxi province where i lived and farmed with villagers and i knew about their worries and needs now half a century on i always feel confident and strong when staying with the people serving the people selflessly and living up to their expectations is my lifelong commitment when i became general secretary of the cpc central committee and president of the peoples republic of china million people were still living below the poverty line set by the united nations thanks to eight years of tenacious efforts we lifted them all out of poverty we realized the poverty reduction goal of the un agenda for sustainable development years ahead of schedule in the process over cpc members lost their lives in the line of duty our goal is not to have just a few wealthy people but to realize common prosperity for all employment education medical services child care elderly care housing the environment and the like are real

enriching the peoples cultural lives enhancing civility throughout society and promoting wellrounded development of the person the purpose of the global civilization initiative i proposed is to urge the international community to address the imbalance between material and cultural advancement and jointly promote continued progress of human civilization we are committed to sustainable development to achieve harmony between man and nature the belief that humans are an integral part of nature and need to follow natures course is a distinctive feature of traditional chinese culture we live in the same global village and we possibly wont find another inhabitable planet in our lifetime as an english saying goes we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors we borrow it from our children when i was governor of fujian province in i called for turning fujian into the first ecological province in china later when i worked in zhejiang province in i said that clear waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver today this view has become a consensus of all the chinese people china now has close to half of the worlds installed photovoltaic capacity over half of the worlds new energy vehicles run on roads in china and china contributes onefourth of increased area of afforestation in the world we will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before and achieve carbon neutrality before we have made the pledge and we will honor it we are committed to peaceful development to build a community with a shared future for mankind peace amity and harmony are values embedded in chinese civilization aggression and expansion are not in our genes the chinese people have bitter and deep memories of the turmoils and sufferings inflicted upon them in modern times i often say that what the chinese people oppose is war what they want is stability and what they hope for is enduring world peace the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation cannot be achieved without a peaceful and stable international environment in pursuing modernization we will never revert to the beaten path of war colonization plundering or coercion throughout the years and more since the founding of the peoples republic china has not provoked a conflict or war or occupied a single inch of foreign land china is the only major country that has written peaceful development into the constitution of the country and the constitution of the governing party thus making peaceful development a commitment of the nation it benefits from and safeguards the current international order we remain firm in safeguarding the international system with the un at its core the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the un charter whatever stage of development it may reach china will never pursue hegemony or expansion and will never impose its will on others china does not seek spheres of influence and will not fight a cold war or a hot war with anyone china will remain committed to dialogue and oppose confrontation and build partnerships instead of alliances it will continue to

development mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity and to build a community with a shared future for mankind ladies and gentlemen friends the passage of time is like a surging river much is washed away but the most valuable stays no matter how the global landscape evolves the historical trend of peaceful coexistence between china and the united states will not change the ultimate wish of our two peoples for exchanges and cooperation will not change the expectations of the whole world for a steadily growing chinaus relationship will not change for any great cause to succeed it

institutional connectivity important guiding principles for highquality belt and road cooperation have been laid down which include the principle of planning together building together and benefiting together the philosophy of open green and clean cooperation and the goal of pursuing highstandard peoplecentered and sustainable cooperation over these years we have endeavored to build a global network of connectivity consisting of economic corridors international transportation routes and information highway as well as railways roads airports ports pipelines and power grids covering the land the ocean the sky and the internet this network has boosted the flow of goods capital technologies and human resources among countries involved and injected fresh vitality into the millenniaold silk road in the new era trains speeding along rail tracks automobiles running on roads flights connecting different countries cargo ships breaking waves and ecommerce bringing so much convenience to people they have all become symbols of international trade in the new era just like camel caravans and the sailing ships were for the past age hydro wind and solar energy based power plants oil and gas pipelines and the increasingly smart and interconnected power transmission networks are removing the development bottleneck caused by energy shortage and fulfilling the dream of developing countries to achieve green and lowcarbon development these energy projects have become the oasis and lighthouse for sustainable development in the new era brand new airports and harbors smooth roads and newly built industrial parks for business cooperation have created new economic corridors and new growth drivers and have become the trading routes and staging posts of the new era rich and colorful cultural years art festivals expos and exhibitions luban workshops peopletopeople exchange programs like the silk road community building initiative and the brightness action program and deepening exchanges between nongovernmental organizations think tanks media organizations and the youth all these flourishing activities have composed a symphony of friendship in the new era when covid struck the belt and road became a lifesaving road china provided more than billion masks and billion doses of vaccines to other countries and jointly produced vaccines with over countries making a special contribution to bri partners efforts in fighting covid and china also received valuable support from more than countries when it was hit hard by the pandemic belt and road cooperation is based on the principle of planning together building together and benefiting together it transcends differences between civilizations cultures social systems and stages of development it has opened up a new path for exchanges among countries and established a new framework for international cooperation indeed the bri represents humanitys joint pursuit of development for all ladies and gentlemen friends our achievements in the past decade are truly remarkable and there is so much we can draw from them we have learned that humankind is a community with a shared future china can only do well when the world is doing well when china does well the world will get even better through belt and road cooperation china is opening its door even wider to the world with its inland regions turning from fullbacks into forwards and coastal regions scaling new heights in their openingup chinas market has become even more closely integrated with the global market china has become a main trading partner of more than countries and territories and a primary source of investment for more countries both chinese investment overseas and foreign investment in china have boosted friendship cooperation confidence and hope we have learned that winwin cooperation is the sure way to success in launching major initiatives that benefit all when countries embrace cooperation and act in concert a deep chasm can be turned into a thoroughfare landlocked countries can become landlinked and a place of underdevelopment can be transformed into a land of prosperity countries taking the lead in economic development should give a hand to their partners who are yet to catch up we should all treat each other as friends and partners respect and support each other and help each other succeed as the saying goes when you give roses to others their fragrance lingers on your hand in other words helping others is also helping oneself viewing others development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make ones own life better or speed up ones development we have learned that the silk road spirit of peace and cooperation openness and inclusiveness mutual learning and mutual benefit is the most important source of strength for belt and road cooperation i once said that the pioneers of the ancient silk routes won their place in history not as conquerors with warships guns horses or swords rather they are remembered as friendly emissaries leading camel caravans and sailing ships loaded with goods belt and road cooperation is based on the belief that flame runs high when everyone adds wood to the fire and that mutual support can get us far such cooperation seeks to deliver a good life not only to people of just one country but to people in other countries as well it promotes connectivity mutual benefit common development cooperation and winwin outcomes ideological confrontation geopolitical rivalry and bloc politics are not a choice for us what we stand against are unilateral sanctions economic coercion and decoupling and supply chain disruption what has been achieved in the past years demonstrates that belt and road cooperation is on the right side of history it represents the advancing of our times and it is the right path forward we need to remain cleareyed and undisturbed in a volatile world and we need to be keenly aware of our responsibility for history for the people and for the world we should jointly address various global risks and challenges and deliver a bright future of peace development cooperation and mutual benefit for future generations ladies and gentlemen friends changes of the world of our times and of historical significance are unfolding like never before china is endeavoring to build itself into a
