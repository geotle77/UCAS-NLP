6 Paperbacks to Read This Week Shreya ChattopadhyayReporting for the Books desk Ready for a new read? Check out these new softcover releases, from novels contending with art-making, revolution and climate collapse to “Master Slave Husband Wife,” one of The Times’s best books of 2023. Here are six paperbacks we recommend →Birnam Wood, by Eleanor CattonCatton’s electric novel follows an alliance between two ideological opposites — Birnam Wood, an anarchist environmentalist group led by a horticulturalist named Mira, and Robert Lemoine, a billionaire building a doomsday bunker — as they come together on a tract of rural land. “The whole thing crackles, like hair drawn through a pocket comb,” our reviewer wrote.Master Slave Husband Wife: An Epic Journey From Slavery to Freedom, by Ilyon WooThis true story of love and liberty was one of our 10 Best Books of 2023. It centers on Ellen and William Craft, an enslaved couple who in December 1848 hatched a daring escape — light-skinned Ellen dressing as a wealthy planter, and William as her property — to the North and eventually across the Atlantic.Biography of X, by Catherine LaceyC.M., the New York City journalist narrating this novel, hated the biography published about her late wife, an artist named X. So she set out to write her own. In it, beneath “the glamour and squalor of Manhattan nightlife, and the mythologies bought and sold, she’s telling a love story of a broken sort,” Dwight Garner wrote in his review.Benjamin Banneker and Us: Eleven Generations of an American Family, by Rachel Jamison WebsterIn what our reviewer called a book about “unknowing rather than knowing,” Webster reconnects with family past and present after discovering she descends from Banneker, a Black astronomer and inventor famous for writing almanacs and a 1791 letter to Thomas Jefferson on slavery’s injustice.The Curator, by Owen KingIn a recently post-revolutionary unnamed city, the Museum of Psykical Research has burned down. Years before, Dora’s brother died during an experiment there. Now, Dora works at the still-intact museum next door to investigate his death. But as supernatural and political forces rear their heads, each secret she uncovers reveals a deeper one.The Far Land: 200 Years of Murder, Mania, and Mutiny in the South Pacific, by Brandon PresserIn 1789, a group of mutineers took over the H.M.S. Bounty and landed in the South Pacific. In 2018, Presser made his own trip to the island of Pitcairn. This thrilling history alternates the stories of the mutineers and their descendants, who still live on the island today.Read more books news:Kate Zambreno Takes Issue With What Counts as ‘Literature’22 of the Funniest Novels Since ‘Catch-22’1 of 81 of 8Item 1 of 81 of 81 of 8
